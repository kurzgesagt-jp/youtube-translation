1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,700
Few of the monsters that evolution created have been so successful at hurting us

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,420
as the variola virus, responsible for smallpox

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,770
The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless 

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,460
that it compelled humankind, for the first time,  to act truly globally.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,510
It was one of the   greatest wins of our species over the ancient  powers of nature,

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,230
all made possible by… 

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,750
cows

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,810
Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only  seeks to reproduce itself.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:43,690
Evidence of It has been found in Egyptian mummies and in writing from India and China as old as 3000 years.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,960
1300 years ago smallpox killed up to a third of  Japan’s population.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,260
By the sixteen hundreds, it   was one of the major causes of death worldwide.

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,140
In late 18th century Europe, it killed 400,000 a year.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,960
Every third person who went blind did so because of this virus.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,290
Even in the 20th century, a hot second ago in history,

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,000
it still killed at  least 300 million people.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,710
Smallpox is an abusive monster that returns over and over and over again, 

17
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,690
killing, maiming, and disrupting societies.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,070
How could variola be so incredibly deadly for so long

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,350
and how could we have forgotten its horror so quickly?

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,040
In 2023, there are only two laboratories left where the living virus is officially stored for research:

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,480
in Koltsovo, Russia and in Atlanta, USA

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,110
Which is certainly a good idea 

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,710
what could possibly go wrong?

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,210
Let’s say that through an unfortunate series of events the virus got out and you got infected. 

25
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,300
What would happen to you? 

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,160
How Smallpox Kills 

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,460
Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride in small droplets you breathe in.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,070
Immediately it begins to infect the cells that line your throat and starts killing them to cause chaos.

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,400
Why? 

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,680
To trick your body into giving it a lift.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,990
Whenever cells in your body die a violent death

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,810
your immune cells immediately stream to the site of infection to help out. 

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,940
In this case that backfires horribly.

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,820
As immune cells begin cleaning up dead cells, eating viruses and killing infected cells

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,040
variola infects a crucial cell of your immune system

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,900
Your Dendritic cells

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,720
intelligence cells that gather information and leave the battlefield to get help. 

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,590
They enter your lymphatic system, 

39
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,700
a highway network that spans yourentire body and connects hundreds of immune bases.

40
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,580
In these bases your heavy defenses are activated and should be the last place an enemy would want to invade, 

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,340
but Variola wants to get here.

42
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,670
For about 12 days, the virus quietly infects civilian and immune cells,

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,060
jumping from cell to cell infecting more and more of them.

44
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,650
At some point a critical threshold is reached and variola starts its attack for real.

45
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,640
Millions of viruses use the lymphatic highway to spill into your blood and organs, infecting your whole body. 

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,210
Suddenly variola is everywhere. 

47
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,720
But despite this global attack, your adaptive immune system is struggling to wake up.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,250
Your immune cells look for and use critical transmitters called interferons to mobilize the body against viruses.

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,060
Interferons, as the name suggests, interfere – significantly slowing down virus infections 

50
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,670
but also quickly activating millions of anti virus weapons.   

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,190
But Variola is able to deactivate interferons,

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,640
which stuns the anti virus side of your defense system.

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,340
Other systems would usually help

54
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,840
like the complement system, a sort of mobile minefield that can destroy viruses

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,900
but variola also manages to shut this down too.

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,660
And so, with little resistance variola spreads everywhere

57
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,190
and infects billions of your cells all over your body

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,140
Among the infected are your capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in your body, 

59
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,140
which die in great numbers.

60
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,690
All this death activates an immune cell that you really don’t need right now but that is attracted by death:

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,120
the Neutrophil

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,340
Normally an efficient killer of invaders great and small, it is not very effective against smallpox.

63
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,060
And even worse, Neutrophils fight by vomiting deadly chemicals, which kills even more of your cells

64
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,230
On top of that, they order inflammation, 

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,530
fluids streaming from your blood vessels into your tissue.

66
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,480
All over your body, as first millions, then billions of your cells die,

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,430
you get a rash that only gets worse and worse. 

68
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,960
Pus and cellular junk fills it up as your body swells up with hundreds of lesions

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,500
all over your skin and inside, even on your organs, 

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,100
all filled with billions of variola viruses. 

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,440
Now the critical phase begins.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,410
As you fight for survival, you burn up in a high fever, 

73
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,980
thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of fluid that streams into your tissue and organs.

74
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,440
Blood clotting appears all over your body 

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,020
while floods of toxins from dead cells build up and can cause organs to fail

76
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,910
Your lungs fill up with fluid, making it harder and harder to breathe. 

77
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,640
One of two things happens now:

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,220
Either your immune system wrestles back control 

79
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,680
heavy weapons have been dispatched, killing infected cells, cleaning up the thousands of infections one by one, 

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,790
killing variola wherever it can be found 

81
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,900
so you can slowly begin to recover. 

82
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,970
The immune system will forever remember variola, making you immune forever. 

83
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,130
Or, you die,

84
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,600
overwhelmed by the infection and your immune system's panicked reaction to the body wide infection.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,790
About a third of people who contract smallpox don’t survive.

86
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,660
And if you survive, you are very likely branded by scars and  may even lose your eyesight or hearing.

87
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,010
For thousands of years this terrible disease ravaged the world,

88
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,990
leaving death and destruction, traumatized and maimed survivors. 

89
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,190
Until one day, humanity said: “enough”.

90
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,070
Why don’t we have smallpox anymore?

91
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,510
Smallpox is one of the worst diseases  humanity has ever known. 

92
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,290
A murderous, family destroying, life ruining monster. 

93
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,430
There was nothing you could do for the infected

94
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,970
but people noticed that if you survived, you were immune.

95
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,000
So out of desperation, they came up with a  dangerous practice of variolation:

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,390
Take scabs from an infected person that had a mild case of smallpox, 

97
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,760
let them dry out and grind them to a fine powder. 

98
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,020
Then blow the powder up the nostril  of a patient or scratch their skin with it. 

99
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,490
If things went well, they only got a mild version of smallpox and gained immunity against the disease.

100
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,200
Variolation probably worked because it introduced  the variola in a part of the body the virus wasn’t prepared for,

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,620
disabling most of its nasty tricks.

102
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,050
And because the inoculation was left to dry out,

103
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,580
that damaged the virus so it could not cause the full disease.

104
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,440
Unfortunately 2-3% of all patients still died 

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,600
because they got the smallpox or suffered other diseases as a result of treatment.

106
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,830
Still,  smallpox was such a horrible and to some degree,   unavoidable disease

107
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,110
that people took the  risk, for themselves and their children.  

108
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,160
Variolation spread around the globe,  while Variola continued to kill millions.

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,430
victory over the virus, only became a real possibility

110
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,230
when scientists realized that it was not necessary to variolate with the real smallpox disease,

111
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,900
but much safer to use material from cowpox,

112
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,260
a variant that affected, surprise,

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,640
cows. 

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,770
A truly revolutionary step – and  only a few years later
this led to one of humankind's most outstanding achievements:

115
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,370
Vaccinations.

116
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,040
The innovation was simple

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,490
instead of using the real virus to train   the immune system, use a related virus, cowpox,

118
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,550
that was only mild but also gave you immunity.

119
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,460
Still, it would take another 200 years, countless  individuals fighting the monster where they could, 

120
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,430
delivering vaccines to the most remote places  on earth. 

121
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,080
All the while the disease ravaged on, killing over 300 million people  in the 20th century alone. 

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,900
In 1966 the World Health Organization decided  that humanity had to come together in a final, major effort. 

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,840
A global "smallpox news network," based on residents in hotspots, was created 

124
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,500
– tackling local outbreaks of the virus.

125
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,720
Cases were encircled, vaccines given, preventing further spread. 

126
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,260
Smallpox only infects humans, so if we stopped the human transmission chain, we would starve the virus.

127
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,730
The last naturally occurring infection was in 1977,

128
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,860
and in 1980, just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine was used, 

129
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,340
Smallpox was declared eradicated. 

130
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,040
Variola, the scourge of humanity, was dead.

131
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,070
No more children would be killed by it, 

132
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,990
no more mothers or brothers or uncles or cousins.

133
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,060
It is hard to convey to people around today what an incredible win this was. 

134
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,140
One of the cruelest, most dangerous monsters   that has hunted us for literally millenia was slain

135
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,800
by us, apes with pointy needles.

136
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,310
Today, we live in a time of Enlightenment,

137
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,910
None of us alive today are haunted by the Specter o smallpox.

138
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,370
This light is not natural;

139
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:54,040
it was set in the sky by the sheer will of humankind wanting to be  safe from the monsters haunting us. 

140
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,060
But because we live without them, we forget  that they ever existed and that they are real.

141
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,480
That the diseases might reawaken, or  new ones might be brewing in

142
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,820
jungles, wet markets or laboratories,  ready to strike us once more.  

143
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,010
We forget what an incredible gift vaccines are and how hard we had to battle to get them

144
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,960
We are still protected by the light but it is cooling each and every day, 

145
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,880
and we owe it to those who will come after us to make sure it doesn't go.

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
We killed one monster. We can do it again.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,240
This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,090
Do you want to continue learning about the fascinating world of biology?

149
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,320
We've got you.

150
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,550
Let’s take a real close look at the human body.  

151
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,830
This is an arm.

152
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,910
And this is a human cell – the microscopic stage where everything happens. 

153
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:50,630
Where all the important battles are fought and where YOU   are constantly built over and over again. 

154
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,270
Even though It’s the smallest unit of life, the cell is extremely complex.

155
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,080
But don’t worry  we managed to fit everything you need to know   on a single poster

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,460
– and in true kurzgesagt fashion it’s easy to understand and even easier on the eyes. 

157
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,510
Grasping a complex topic is much easier when it’s presented in exciting ways.

158
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,070
The poster was researched and designed  in collaboration with molecular biologist James Gurney

159
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:22,590
– so it’s expert approved  and contains all the latest cutting edge   science about organelles, their function  and their place in the cellular world. 

160
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,580
We love bringing science into your home with our videos and we are so excited whenever we get to do it literally. 

161
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,950
This is why we take hundreds of hours to create our science posters

162
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,060
– all researched with care and crafted with love by us here at kurzgesagt.

163
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,060
We love having such a curious audience

164
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:45,820
and we want to inspire you and all   the birbs in your life to learn all about  biology, space, humans and life itself.
