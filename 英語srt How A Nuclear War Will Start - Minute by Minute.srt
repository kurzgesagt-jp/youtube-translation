1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,010
Mr. President! Nuclear missiles will strike our country in 14 minutes.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,010
I know it’s your first day in office so I’m going to walk you through it,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,930
but you’re the only one who can authorize our nuclear retaliation in response 

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,960
and you’ve only got a few minutes to make a decision! 

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,600
As you know tensions have escalated rapidly in the past few days.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
Today’s joint allied aerial defense exercise began just minutes before we detected the launch. 

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,420
A simple misunderstanding maybe.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,270
We assume the sudden attack is meant to neutralize as many of our nuclear forces as possible. 

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,330
But that doesn’t matter now – missiles are in the air and we can’t shoot all of them down.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,950
Why? Because Intercontinental ballistic missiles are basically rockets launched into space 

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,150
before re-entering the atmosphere over their target and releasing many different warheads.

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,330
Higher and faster than anything you can send after them.

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,780
We need to get you to the bunker! 

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,140
Here is what we know: Four minutes ago our new infrared monitoring satellites detected one hundred twelve bursts 

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,650
consistent with ICBM launches from the enemy’s inner territories.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,090
For some reason only 20 of their 80 underground nuclear silos seem to have fired,

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,880
so we suspect most of them were transporter-erector launchers, you know: trucks with big missiles on them. 

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:23,060
It’s unclear why they didn’t use all their silos – they might just not work after more than thirty years or they might be keeping them in reserve.

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,980
The fog of war is keeping many things unclear! 

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:33,680
Aerospace Command thinks the ICBMs are targeting our nuclear command centers,　silos, and major airforce and navy bases,

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,570
ending this war before we have a chance to act!

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,750
The enemy’s strategic doctrine prioritizes military targets and our nuclear weapon   systems, 

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,570
but their secondary targets are our industry and infrastructure –

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,870

25
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,450
All located near or in major population centers. 

26
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,740
We won’t know the exact casualty count for a few weeks. 

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,790
Deaths from the blast and burns may be a few million today.

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,060
It’s morning rush hour and there’s not much to be done for people stuck in traffic. 

29
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,740
People in major metro areas can’t really evacuate, 

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,280
but emergency broadcasts are being sent out to shelter in place and away from windows. 

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,640
Radiation exposure for intact population centers is highly dependent on the weather over the next week.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,370
We might be looking at dozens of millions of deaths by the end of the month.

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,020
For the next few minutes we can still respond, 

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,260
but – You need to decide!

35
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,960
We’ve got 1500 warheads across our silos, bombers, and submarines. 

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,010
The 400 in silos need to be launched now before they get taken out.

37
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,920
46 nuclear capable bombers on high alert can be ready to take off in 2 minutes 

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,970
though we need to transmit the order now to get them out of the blast radius if you want to consider using them.

39
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,280
Of our 14 nuclear submarines, 5 are presently at sea. 

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,700
While they’re submerged they’re undetectable, so that’s our back-up for a nuclear retaliation if we lose our silos and bombers. 

41
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,350
We could try to use them to bomb out their remaining silo fields before they can launch them. 

42
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,260
The sooner you commit to it, the better the chance we have of preventing a further exchange after our retaliation.

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,970
Updates!

44
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,310
We have radar confirmation that the enemy ICBMs have completed their burn and deployed their warheads.

45
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,020
Our best guess is that each missile will deploy at least 6 re-entry vehicles, about 600 in total, 

46
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,950
which is the part that carries a warhead back into the atmosphere during its terminal descent onto the target 

47
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,600
and with many more decoys on top of that, inflatable balloons meant to waste any anti-missiles

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,350
We’re now tracking nearly 4000 potential targets.

49
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,220
Our anti-ballistic missiles have been launched and will begin their intercept in another minute.

50
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,310
We’ll do our best to protect the capital, although there really is no defense. 

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,740
Wait… confirming a partial radar blackout, our systems seem to be glitchy.

52
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,460
The enemy must have anticipated we’d launch our interceptors and pre-detonated a few warheads at high altitude. 

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,700
That ionizes the atmosphere and creates radar interference.

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,110
Our interceptors should still operate okay, they’ve had a 55% success rate in tests

55
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,040
but never with this many decoys or with radar interference this intense. 

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,980
We might shoot down 50 objects, but there’s no guarantee they’re warheads.

57
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,050
It looks like most bombs are going to get through. 

58
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,340
This is our last chance to counterattack.

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,640
We’re out of time. Our silo launch sequence takes 5 minutes. 

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,480
We have to transmit and confirm a launch order and the missile needs time to clear the blast radius of the incoming bomb. 

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,690
This is a lot to take in, but the war plan is made, you just need to enter the launch authorization codes

62
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,960
and push this button to transmit them! 

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,630
You can’t do anything else to save more of our people. 

64
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,510
If you don’t launch now then this war will be over before it even begins 

65
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,530
you understand this is our one chance, right? 

66
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,640
The effect? Enemy civilian casualties are hard to estimate, but should be similar to ours – a few million right away, 

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,530
perhaps a few tens of million by the end of the month.

68
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,630
the total fallout from their attacks and ours might trigger a nuclear winter, 

69
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,910
potentially killing billions around the world,

70
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,820
but that might happen even if we don’t retaliate. 

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,310
I’m sure you have questions but you have to give orders without expecting answers right now. 

72
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,980
With an attack of this scale there’s no guarantee communications or assets will be intact in a few minutes. 

73
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,270
We’re out of time, we need a decision Sir.

74
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,140
Can we launch? 

75
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,870
Nuclear wars aren’t regular wars. 

76
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,590
They only last minutes, and in times of crisis, small conflicts can rapidly spiral out of control.

77
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,330
Anything from small communication lags to sensor errors to just uncertainty and the fog of war

78
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,090
mean that no leader will ever have a complete idea of what’s happening as a crisis unfolds.

79
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:45,750
When tensions are high, accidents or misunderstandings can steer leaders even those with good intentions to launch a nuclear attack. 

80
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,250
Confused and with incomplete information,

81
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,590
a single person

82
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,030
– yes, it's really just ONE single person who decides – 

83
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,220
can literally make civilization ending decisions killing hundreds of millions of people in the time it takes to watch a YouTube video.

84
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,860
This story is fiction with a very close to that several times

85
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,010
In 1995 Russian radar detected a submarine launched missile and their nuclear forces went on full alert, 

86
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,720
except it was actually a scientific rocket to study auroras.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,460
In 1979, US computers reported a full scale Soviet attack with only minutes to respond – 

88
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,320
except it was a training tape being incorrectly loaded into a computer.

89
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,140
In 1983, the Soviet satellite alert system showed five ICBMs launched from the US.

90
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,250
But it was a false alarm caused by sunlight reflected on clouds.

91
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,200
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine with no contact to Moscow for several days

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,680
concluded that nuclear war had begun and decided to launch a nuclear torpedo. 

93
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,000
Luckily the authorization of three officers was required. 

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,500
One of them, Vasily Arkhipov, opposed it. 

95
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,110
But what if he hadn’t?

96
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,440
Any safeguard can fail, no matter how carefully designed it might be. 

97
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,540
and decisions are being made right now to build you weapons and missile systems.

98
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,570
that commit the world to another century of nuclear stalemate,

99
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,840
complicated further by China's emergence as a new nuclear superpower.

100
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,650
Simply accepting that the existence of nuclear weapons is inevitable 

101
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,650
might mean their use is inevitable

102
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,930
But the world doesn’t have to be this way. 

103
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,940
Even incremental steps, taking apart one bomb at a time, 

104
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,870
will eventually result in a world with none. 

105
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,060
During the Cold War, the world had over 70,000 nuclear weapons –

106
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,850
through arms reduction treaties, that number is now about 12,500.

107
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,560
Progress is not guaranteed, but it’s also not impossible.

108
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,220
Governments and militaries are not separate from their nations, they’re part of them, just like you.

109
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,700
You have the power to make demands of your leaders and often this begins with just being aware of an issue. 

110
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,140
If you want to learn more, we've compiled a number of resources for you in the video description and our sources. 

111
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,890
This video was supported by Open Philanthropy. 

112
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:02,950
Did you know that there are countless more kurzgesagt videos that we upload on TikTok, Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels?

113
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,740
Byte-sized information, animated facts and inspiring thought experiments.

114
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,960
After all, you also need videos you can watch quickly in a bathroom break! 

115
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,020
Our longer, more in depth videos are happening here on Youtube

116
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,640
Short form is a completely different challenge that we are trying to do as well as possible

117
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,420
 – check them out if you are curious! 

118
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,190
And if you want to discuss and share your thoughts about Science with other like-minded people,

119
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,700
why don’t you check out our Discord community with over 80,000 birbs?

120
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,000
We have channels where you can chat about STEM topics, participate in events and the “academic question of the week” 

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,580
and we have the best emotes!

122
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,180
After all, we want to spark your curiousity,

123
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,830
but it’s always more fun to be curious together!

124
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,370
See you over there!
