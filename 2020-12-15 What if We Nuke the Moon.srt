1
00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:06,160
What would happen if we were to detonate a very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon?

2
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:11,624
Would the explosion knock its orbit towards earth, causing tidal waves and misery?

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,770
Could the moon be destroyed, showering the earth in a rain of meteoric death?

4
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:31,887
During the cold war the moon was a major target for space exploration and you know, military bases.

5
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:39,227
So the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear detonation on the surface of the moon.

6
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:44,457
But just quoting stuff is boring, so let’s conduct a very important scientific experiment

7
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:48,236
with an imaginary 100 megaton thermonuclear warhead,

8
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:52,683
about twice as powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated.

9
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:57,696
We’ll also place a number of curious astronauts around the moon as observers.

10
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:01,893
Let’s push the button and slow down time.

11
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:06,115
For the first few milliseconds nothing much happens outside our weapon.

12
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,600
Meanwhile inside, high explosives send a shockwave to a radioactive metal core,

13
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:17,854
compressing it so much that it reaches criticality and starts a nuclear fission chain reaction.

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,093
The 100 million degree plasma created in this first stage sets off the second stage,

15
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,279
with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star.

16
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:32,633
Very briefly, our weapon contains one of the hottest places in the universe.

17
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:38,776
And only now, barely ten milliseconds later, does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened,

18
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:44,416
as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born.

19
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:46,031
So far so good.

20
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:52,024
But everything that happens now is very different from what we’re used to on earth because of one major difference:

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,216
There’s no atmosphere.

22
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:58,750
As the fireball shines it releases a flash of X-rays and thermal photons,

23
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:03,123
a wave of silent heat which rushes outwards in all directions.

24
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,530
On earth, this heat would char and burn everything within a 50 kilometer radius at least.

25
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:13,683
But on the moon, without an atmosphere and oxygen-rich air, there’s no burning at all.

26
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,285
Also there are no things to burn.

27
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,503
The crunchy topsoil of the moon is made from silicate rock and metals

28
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:25,756
chewed to dust by eons of meteorite impacts, mixed with tiny traces of water.

29
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:31,263
When heated by the explosion, X-rays from the fireball vaporize a thin cloud of rock from the lunar surface,

30
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:35,636
while the unlucky dust that’s inside the fireball melts into glass.

31
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:41,096
Any astronauts watching the show within about 50 km can expect to be fried.

32
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:46,864
And now, we begin to see one of the biggest differences between explosions in space and on earth.

33
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,663
On earth the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble:

34
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:57,584
Its expansion is violently stopped within moments by the pressure of the atmosphere. But this is not good news.

35
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,844
As the fireball rams the atmosphere it produces the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion on earth: the shockwave.

36
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,004
Compressed air around the explosion rushes out faster than the speed of sound,

37
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,016
shattering buildings and roaring so loud it ruptures organs.

38
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:19,944
But on the moon there is no shockwave. No atmosphere means nothing to impede the expanding explosion in space.

39
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:27,183
On the moon, the fireball just grows in eerie silence as there is no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice.

40
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,480
This would be an amazing thing to watch from a safe distance.

41
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:35,843
Unfortunately there’s hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on the moon.

42
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:40,430
Without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA,

43
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:45,578
anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation.

44
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,850
But of course, that’s not all.

45
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:51,110
While all of this happens the explosion hammers against the moon,

46
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:57,964
transferring about a tenth of the explosion energy into seismic waves, powering an intense moonquake.

47
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:05,224
The moon is much smaller than the earth, and our astronauts will feel an inescapable violent shaking no matter where they’re standing.

48
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,330
Compared to an earthquake of 7 on the Richter scale,

49
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:14,416
this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure we might have built anywhere on the moon.

50
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:14,376
Those who hid on the far side of the moon would have no idea it was an explosion,

51
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,646
the quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck.

52
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:24,946
And it’s not over yet:

53
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:30,300
Where our bomb explodes, the ground splatters like water when a rock strikes a pond.

54
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:36,940
As the explosion pushes against the surface it may excavate as much as a hundred million cubic meters of dust and rock,

55
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:42,340
forming a crater a kilometer across while bedrock is pulverized to rubble.

56
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,712
Debris is shot into the sky in every direction.

57
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:50,472
Again without an atmosphere there’s no drag to slow any of it down.

58
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:56,466
Much of the debris scattered never returns to the moon, flying off faster than escape velocity.

59
00:04:56,492 --> 00:05:00,756
A flurry of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore the solar system,

60
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:05,716
many of which will rain down on the earth, though few will be larger than pebbles.

61
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:11,570
Any satellite, astronaut or space station in the way though will have a really bad time.

62
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:18,364
Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds and angles, allowing them to spread all over the surface of the moon.

63
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,083
Like bullets they’ll punch through our curious astronauts no matter where they stand.

64
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:27,206
Finally, our explosion comes to an end.

65
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:31,969
On earth, the fireball rises like a hot air balloon forming a sort of stalk;

66
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:37,256
as it reaches up cooler air is drawn in around it, rounding the top into a mushroom cloud.

67
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:41,817
But on the moon, well, you know by now: no atmosphere, no mushroom.

68
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:48,496
The larger the plasma gets, the cooler it becomes, and the less energy it has to make interesting or terrifying things happen.

69
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:53,476
Within seconds of pulling the trigger, the bubble reddens and fades from view.

70
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:59,590
It would be visible from the earth, like a star flickering to life only to fade out right away.

71
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:02,071
A spark, and then nothing.

72
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:05,849
As the cloud of tiny debris reaches far above the surface of the moon,

73
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:13,490
it’s illuminated by the sun for a few minutes giving it an eerie beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle.

74
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:18,071
What about the moon’s orbit? It is basically unchanged.

75
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:22,450
Trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it.

76
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:27,130
Nuclear explosions may be big, but space is bigger.

77
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:32,337
Our mighty explosion just leaves another crater. One among millions.

78
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:36,603
Still, anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves.

79
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,870
The material that ends up raining back to the moon is radioactive,

80
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:46,230
and without any natural processes to wash it away or bury it, the surface of the moon will remain contaminated.

81
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:54,216
Although fortunately, the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to natural levels from cosmic rays in about a year.

82
00:06:54,242 --> 00:07:01,230
In conclusion we can say with confidence that while the moon itself does not care about being nuked and will barely notice,

83
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:08,910
using the moon as a nuclear test ground kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something useful.

84
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:12,793
So maybe we should just not do that.

85
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:17,464
This was our last video of the year 12020 and,

86
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:21,189
oh dear what an interesting and weird year its been in all the worst ways.

87
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,723
But its finally over.

88
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,850
We want to end by saying thank you.

89
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:29,640
We get to do this channel and work on many exciting things because of you birds.

90
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,725
This year our German channel reached to million subscribes,

91
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:36,620
we launched our Spanish one, and released our first app.

92
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:41,340
If everything goes well, we can finally start our largest new project today next year,

93
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,612
but we know better than to promise too much.

94
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:46,373
All of this works because you supported us directly.

95
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,291
Thank you so much. We genially appreciated.

96
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:54,736
If you want to help us and to get some cool return, to the tuning of nuking the moon,

97
00:07:54,762 --> 00:08:00,370
we made a new minimalistic infographic poster about the moon, and how incredibly far away it is,

98
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:06,406
also there is baby duck our cutest plushy yet, a new duck and friends enamel mug,

99
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:10,166
our new ocean explorer note book, and so much more.

100
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:14,467
All made with love and care. Let us know what you like and we’ll make more of it.

101
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,846
OK. Let’s wrap up this video and this year.

102
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,278
Thank you again for watching and caring and sharing.

103
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:25,600
We hope that you slide peacefully into the year 12021.

104
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:30,140
Let’s all hope it will be really boring year!
