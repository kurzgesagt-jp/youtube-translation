1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,360
The future of humanity seems insecure.

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:09,848
Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism

3
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:12,828
and so many people think our end is in sight.

4
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:16,181
But humans have always thought they lived in the end times.

5
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:22,535
Every generation assumes they’re important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,280
This is a problem because it leads to short term thinking

7
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:30,376
and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendents.

8
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:36,881
What makes this worse is that we may actually BE living at an extremely critical moment in human history.

9
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:42,175
To understand why, let us look at the temporal window of humanity and ask:

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,899
When will the last human be born and how many people will there ever be?

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,705
These sorts of estimates come with a lot of uncertainties, so please take them with a gigantic grain of salt.

12
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:07,381
To get a sense of how many people there will be, let us see how many have already lived.

13
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:10,821
Modern humans arose some 200 thousand years ago.

14
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:15,301
They were uniquely good at making tools, telling stories, thinking abstractly,

15
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:19,655
planning and working together in large groups beyond their close family.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,081
Still there were not that many of us.

17
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:28,545
Surpluses in food were sparse, survival was hard, life expectancy was low.

18
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,415
It took us 150,000 years to grow to a population of 2 million.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,235
Improvements were gradual and eventually led to the agricultural revolution,

20
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,375
arguably the biggest change in our history.

21
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,106
This was when our numbers really started growing.

22
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:47,803
It took ten thousand more years to get to 300 million.

23
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:51,368
But that increase was dwarfed by the industrial revolution.

24
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:54,563
In 1800 there were a billion of us.

25
00:01:54,588 --> 00:02:00,095
The human population doubled in just 120 years and then again in fifty.

26
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,935
Today, we number around 8 billion.

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,378
In total, over the last two hundred thousand years about 117 billion humans were born and lived,

28
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:12,311
and 109 billion also died.

29
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:17,225
Which means that about 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive right now.

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,690
As many as were born in the first 150,000 years of human history.

31
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:27,195
Every minute, 270 babies join the party.

32
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:33,498
But there are not just more people, never before have we been as healthy and well off, or lived longer.

33
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:37,158
With growing living standards our birth rates collapsed.

34
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:42,038
The UN estimates that around the year 2100 we will hit our population peak

35
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:46,330
and there will be 125 million people born each year.

36
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:53,358
It is pretty unlikely that birth rates will stay stable forever, but let’s pretend to make our thought experiment simpler.

37
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:58,191
How many people there will be in the future depends on when our species will die out.

38
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:01,585
And here we find a lot of uncertainties.

39
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:04,658
We are able to destroy ourselves through our own inventions

40
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:09,198
– but we are also able to find solutions to avert catastrophic risk.

41
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:14,578
We can change the direction of planet killer asteroids but we’ve also invented nuclear weapons.

42
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:19,978
We discovered antibiotics but also carry diseases across the globe in a matter of days.

43
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:26,238
Our industrial system gave us an incredible standard of living but also changed the atmosphere in the process.

44
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:32,178
It is very hard to say if human ingenuity will prolong or shorten our species’ lifespan.

45
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,470
If things go badly our end could come suddenly.

46
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:40,643
But if we manage to avoid that, we could conceivably stick around for a long time.

47
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:46,701
So every day we don’t destroy ourselves may mean life for an unfathomable number of humans.

48
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,445
How many people are we talking about?

49
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,490
It depends on how far our species is going to expand.

50
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:57,743
Scenario 1: Humans will never leave Earth

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,591
If we stay on our home planet, a good metric to look at is the extinction rate of animals that we get from the fossil record.

52
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:09,745
The average lifespan of mammalian species is in the region of 1 million years,

53
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,945
with some surviving up to 10 million years.

54
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,731
Our close relative homo erectus survived for about 1.9 million years.

55
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:23,103
Let us be conservative and assume that humans will survive for a million years,

56
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:26,491
which leaves us 800,000 more years to dawdle away.

57
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,480
Assuming a stable birth rate of 125 million people each year,

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,031
this means there are roughly 100 TRILLION humans waiting to be born.

59
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:39,678
850 times greater than the number of people that have ever lived.

60
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:47,255
This would make everybody alive today only 0.008% of all people that will ever live.

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,325
Think about where this leaves you.

62
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,405
Instead of putting you at the end of the chaotic mess that was our past,

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,335
it would mean you live at the very beginning of something big.

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,158
The start of the human story rather than the end.

65
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:04,558
Doesn’t this feel incredibly different?

66
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:09,255
And now consider that this may be an extremely pessimistic estimate.

67
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,803
If we match the survival time of the most successful mammals,

68
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:18,070
then our future numbers rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be born.

69
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,105
And even this seems far from our potential:

70
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:27,360
As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter, earth will remain habitable for about 500 million years,

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,015
giving so many more potential people the chance to become actual people.

72
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,513
And now let’s begin to think big.

73
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,806
Scenario 2: Humans will leave Earth

74
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,195
We went from humans worshipping the moon, to humans walking on it,

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,735
so who knows how much farther we can go?

76
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,431
If we don't die out within the next few hundred years,

77
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:55,938
ideas that seem outlandish right now become serious considerations.

78
00:05:55,963 --> 00:06:00,065
If we believe that we have a chance of surviving for maybe millions of years,

79
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,205
then we could expand onto the other planets or into our own artificial worlds.

80
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:10,176
Life needs three things: a surface, resources and energy.

81
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:13,045
Our Sun provides energy for billions of years

82
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:17,151
and there is so much water and material floating in the asteroid and kuiper belt

83
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,855
that we could sustain many times our current population.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,095
Instead of living on planets, we could decide to construct our own artificial worlds and habitats.

85
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,151
With resources and energy so abundant, we could try out different types of society and ways of life.

86
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:40,293
An interconnected civilization spanning the solar system would create the basis of existence for an absurd number of individuals,

87
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,335
orders of magnitude more than if we stick to earth, even if it only existed for a few million years.

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,058
This future doesn’t have to be grim and dark as science fiction likes to paint it.

89
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,703
With quadrillions of people waiting to be born,

90
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:58,238
we will have billions of doctors working on curing cancer,

91
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:01,150
billions of problem solvers working on ending poverty

92
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:04,875
and billions of video game developers making life fun.

93
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:09,815
More humans may actually mean more progress.

94
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,565
Another upside of leaving earth and spreading out is that it becomes much harder for us to become extinct,

95
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,871
as you need a solar system wide catastrophe to catch everybody.

96
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:23,211
So aside from nearby supernovae or Gamma Rays bursts,

97
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:28,485
humanity would be relatively safe from extinction, maybe for billions of years.

98
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:35,231
If we manage to survive for that long, slow evolution or genetic engineering might split us into multiple species,

99
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:39,171
or we might intentionally keep ourselves the same as we are now.

100
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:44,695
So to account for that, we’ll just talk about people from now on, instead of humans.

101
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,049
Ok. Now let us think really big.

102
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,916
Szenario 3: People leave the Solar System

103
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:58,751
As enormous as the solar system is, it is just one star system among billions in the milky way.

104
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:04,416
If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion stars and live there for 10 billion years,

105
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:12,311
while each generating 100 million births per year, then we can expect something like a hundred Octillion lives to be lived in the future.

106
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:18,224
This is a 1 with 29 zeros, a hundred thousand trillion, trillion.

107
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,891
We can spin this up as much as we like.

108
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:26,564
The Andromeda Galaxy will merge with the Milky way, adding another trillion stars for us to settle.

109
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,450
Red Dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion years

110
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:35,124
and future civilizations might even find energy for their habitats around black holes.

111
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:41,318
A sufficiently advanced civilization of our descendants might even try to reach other galaxy groups.

112
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:48,325
While these numbers are mind blowing, they may underestimate the number of unborn people by many orders of magnitude.

113
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,571
If we divide the total energy available in a galaxy by the average energy needs of a single person,

114
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:56,871
then we get a tredecillion potential lives.

115
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:01,643
A million, trillion, trillion, trillion potential people.

116
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,598
Conclusion

117
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:08,794
Hopefully what has become evident is that if we don’t kill ourselves in the next few centuries or millennia,

118
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,834
almost all humans that will ever exist, will live in the future.

119
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,336
Which brings us back to us, in the present.

120
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:22,371
We exist at a highpoint of human history, with incredible possibilities at our grasp.

121
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,695
Technological, environmental and societal.

122
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,887
What we do matters for all the people who do not exist yet.

123
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:35,385
So while it is not en vogue to think about humanity's long term future with optimism

124
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,938
– or to think about it at all –, maybe this has given you a bit of perspective.

125
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:44,591
If we screw up the present, so many people may never come to exist.

126
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:48,390
Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.

127
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:54,303
Even if we go with fairly conservative estimates, the unborn are by far the largest group of people

128
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,870
– and the most disenfranchised.

129
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:03,815
Somebody who might be born in a thousand or even a million years deeply depends on us today for their existence.

130
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,058
This is why it is important to think about the distant future

131
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:12,438
and why our presence is so crucial, why it matters what we do today.

132
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:16,625
One day the last human will be born. We don’t know when.

133
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,838
But if we change our perspective from us living at the end of the human story,

134
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:26,883
to us living at the very beginning we can not only build a wonderful world for us and for them

135
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:31,410
but also for countless numbers of others.

136
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:37,324
HUGE announcement: we are launching Kurzgesagt in six more languages!

137
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:42,761
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Hindi, Japanese and Korean,

138
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:46,143
on top of our English, German and Spanish channels.

139
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:50,976
To bring new perspectives and a love for science to as many people as possible

140
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:56,465
– especially to some languages that are underserved because it is not profitable to translate to.

141
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,011
If enough people watch our new channels, we hopefully can run them for many years to come!

142
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,678
This is where we need YOUR help.

143
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:11,025
It takes us a lot of time, effort and yes, money to translate our videos properly and run so many channels

144
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,445
– so to make this sustainable, please help us spread the word!

145
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,318
If you are a native in one of these languages, share our videos on social media and tell your friends and family

146
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:24,775
– make people in your native language aware that it exists.

147
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,305
This multi language expansion is supported by Open Philanthropy,

148
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,363
