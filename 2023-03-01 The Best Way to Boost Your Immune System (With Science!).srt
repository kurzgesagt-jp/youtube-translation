1
00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:05,347
There is this idea floating around that what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.

2
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,200
That surviving a disease leaves you better off.

3
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:11,474
And it seems to make sense because we have all experienced this.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,600
When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult situation in the future.

5
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:22,700
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.

6
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:26,240
So, what happens when you get sick?

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,163
The Machinery of War

8
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:40,616
Think of yourself as a large country, with a sizable army to defend it.

9
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:46,040
You are surrounded by enemies that want to take your land, your energy, your resources.

10
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:52,493
This is a matter of life and death, so your body evolved to be sensitive to damage and to the presence of enemies.

11
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:57,750
Because this means that an invasion might happen at any moment and that it has to act fast.

12
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:01,630
Let us start an invasion and see what happens.

13
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:08,590
The moment your cells notice that something is off, they release an onslaught of signal proteins called cytokines.

14
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:12,183
They are like air raid sirens that activate all sorts of immune cells,

15
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,710
that then themselves release many more cytokines, amplifying the alarm.

16
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:21,126
Soon you are flooded with signals that trigger precautions and counter-measures.

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,714
Mobilization is under way.

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,250
Your brain activates sickness behavior and reorganizes your body's priorities to defense.

19
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:33,343
The first thing you notice is that your energy level drops and you get sleepy.

20
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,210
You feel apathetic, often anxious or down and you lose your appetite.

21
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:42,153
Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and you seek out rest.

22
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:47,546
All of this serves to save your energy and reroute it into your immune response.

23
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:51,500
You become a country under attack switching into a war economy,

24
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:56,573
because properly activating your immune system is intensely disruptive and draining.

25
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,019
Just like war is expensive for a country as industry switches to building tanks,

26
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:07,416
your immune system demands huge amounts of energy, amino acids and micro elements to build its weapons.

27
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:12,583
Take fever: it speeds up your metabolism and makes your cells work harder and faster,

28
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,998
while creating heat that is pretty stressful for many invaders

29
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:18,980
 – but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain.

30
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,063
Then your immune system begins to clone millions of specialized immune cells

31
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,414
to respond specifically to the enemy infecting you.

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,894
B Cells produce millions of antibodies every second, each requiring hundreds of amino acids to construct.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,693
Billions or even trillions of proteins need to be made to refresh the complement system,

34
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,130
a minefield inside your blood.

35
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:46,042
Cytokines, the mobilisation and information signals, also need constant refreshing.

36
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:49,302
Usually you acquire your resources by eating.

37
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:54,970
But when you are sick, your body slows down your digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can’t spare.

38
00:02:54,996 --> 00:03:00,212
So it reaches for the easiest source of amino acids and starts breaking down your muscles.

39
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:05,863
All that muscle that you worked so hard for is sacrificed to keep you alive.

40
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,115
If you are young and healthy and fit, you will make up for that quickly once you are better.

41
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:16,189
But if you are old or very young, weak or suffer from chronic illness, this may be way too draining.

42
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:20,310
Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going.

43
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:23,617
If your whole system is already strained, when you get sick,

44
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:28,573
just keeping your immune responses going can overwhelm your capacities.

45
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,500
Your Immune System is a Jerk. Our enemies too.

46
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:36,660
Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies.

47
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:43,103
There is a very fragile balance between the damage caused by an infection and the collateral damage caused by immune cells.

48
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:49,643
One of your first responders are Neutrophils – imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns.

49
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:56,428
If a Neutrophil encounters enemies it showers them with chemicals that cut them open but can also damage civilian cells,

50
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:00,860
especially if the patient is already compromised, for example by smoking.

51
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:06,113
On top of that the microorganisms that invade you often release chemicals and toxins

52
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,750
that can cause significant damage and cell death.

53
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:15,126
So a serious infection often causes many tiny wounds, literally holes in your organs.

54
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:21,197
As you can imagine it is not great to have holes and wounds in your organs, and your body rushes to close them.

55
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:26,944
Your Neutrophils and Macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs,

56
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,607
and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells.

57
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:37,690
But others are filled with collagen, a sort of fix-all organic cement that gives your gooey tissue structural integrity.

58
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:40,720
You have seen the result on your skin as scars.

59
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:43,166
A scar is different from the original tissue.

60
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:47,913
It has no functioning cells in it, it is like a sloppily applied cement patch.

61
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,550
It can’t do what the original tissue was doing.

62
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:54,030
A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny bit weaker.

63
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:57,403
A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen.

64
00:04:57,429 --> 00:05:00,926
A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter.

65
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:07,919
And so, as you go through life and survive serious disease after serious disease, the functionality of your organs may decrease.

66
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:13,766
This damage is usually small enough not to affect your quality of life – but can be permanent.

67
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:19,165
Ok, this sounds depressing, but there is actually something you can do to avoid a lot of this damage

68
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,900
and train your immune system!

69
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:25,026
The best way to train your Immune System

70
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,120
Your immune system is unique.

71
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:32,760
Everyone has a slightly different immune system that’s stronger against some enemies and weaker against others.

72
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:38,593
Which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects our species from being wiped out by a single infection.

73
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:45,013
Collectively, the immune system of the human species is a spectrum: most people respond well enough to an infection,

74
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,583
a few are super-responders and a few don't respond well and die.

75
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,770
Some people survived the black death,

76
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:56,906
are more resistant to HIV or Corona virus or even resistant against Ebola.

77
00:05:56,932 --> 00:06:02,616
Others are killed easily by the flu or highly vulnerable to certain bacterial infections.

78
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,770
Where you are on this spectrum is impossible to predict.

79
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:09,977
And you also respond differently to every possible infection.

80
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:13,510
This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from Covid

81
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:17,836
while for some elderly people it was more like a mild flu.

82
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:22,526
The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold is wrong.

83
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:26,673
You never know what your immune system is good at until it is tested.

84
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,000
Getting sick is a gamble in life’s casino with your health on the line. Always.

85
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:38,537
But there is something you can do: hacking one of the best features of your immune system.

86
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:43,106
When you survive a disease, usually you have better defenses against it afterwards –

87
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:47,433
you gain memory cells that are very good at killing the specific enemy you fought that day.

88
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,450
So you either don’t get the disease again or the next infection is much milder.

89
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:59,130
And you can use an incredible achievement of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism to prevent damage from disease

90
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:02,863
and train your immune system: Vaccines.

91
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:09,390
Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease and train your defenses to be ready if it ever shows up for real.

92
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:14,516
The goal is to create the same memory cells that you would get after surviving an infection.

93
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,857
But if you can feel some side effects, why should you still do it?

94
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:22,356
Nature Vs Vaccine Dojo

95
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:28,650
You have two options to train your immune system: Vaccine Dojo and nature dojo.

96
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:33,516
In vaccine dojo you train with paper weapons and learn to defend yourself.

97
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,400
Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise.

98
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:40,840
Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for a few days, but that’s generally it.

99
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,436
No scars, no permanent damage.

100
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:48,130
We discussed vaccine side effects in detail in another video if you want to learn more.

101
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:53,230
On the other hand, getting a disease to become immune means going to a nature dojo.

102
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:58,266
In nature dojo, you train with real weapons, sharp knives and swords.

103
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:02,504
Things might still work out, but with way more cuts and wounds.

104
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,484
But from time to time someone will die, be it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza.

105
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,266
Nature dojo is just way more risky.

106
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:16,516
On top of that, the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural resistance,

107
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,820
because they are engineered to engage your immune system in a more productive way.

108
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:26,580
Of course vaccines are not magic and sometimes they do not protect us as well as we’d like them to.

109
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,876
Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly, like the Omicron coronavirus,

110
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:36,783
or because your specific immune system does not respond well to the vaccine and builds less of a defense.

111
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:42,510
Still, being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses.

112
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:46,959
In the end, if we look at the stunning progress humanity has made in the last century,

113
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,386
eventually we may overcome disease for good.

114
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:54,780
But until then we can do our best to take care of ourselves and others -

115
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:59,539
your body and your older self will be grateful to you.

116
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,390
Diseases are not the only problem humanity can address if we work together.

117
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:09,073
We believe the same is true for climate change, one of the main challenges of our generation.

118
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:13,944
We are very passionate about this topic and we have covered it extensively in previous videos.

119
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:20,486
Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different levels of society, from governments and economies down to the individual.

120
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:24,990
And there’s one way you can take action now – by working with our friends from Wren,

121
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:27,559
who help you offset your carbon emissions.

122
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:33,593
By visiting wren.co and answering a few questions you can find out what your personal carbon footprint is.

123
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,836
Your first step should be reducing your footprint – but there are limits to that.

124
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:43,963
Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription that supports projects that plant trees,

125
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:47,270
protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from the sky.

126
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:51,650
We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate crisis.

127
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:56,413
Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution you’ll get pictures and updates from the project you support,

128
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:59,163
so you can directly see the impact you are making.

129
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:05,417
We appreciate Wren’s focus on transparency and impact, so you can always retrace how your money is spent.

130
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:09,760
One project we find especially interesting is Refrigerant Destruction —

131
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:12,896
Old refrigerators use harmful gases as a coolant.

132
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:18,964
These gases, once released into the atmosphere, cause global warming thousands of times faster than CO2.

133
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,683
Wren’s project permanently destroys containers filled with these gases—

134
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,156
proving, with high certainty, that they’ll never leak and contribute to global warming.

135
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:31,626
