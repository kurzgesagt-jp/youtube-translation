1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:05,580
There is this idea floating around that what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,920
That surviving a disease leaves you better off.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,690
And it seems to make sense because we have all experienced this.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,919
When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,800
situation in the future.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,480
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:34,010
So, what happens when you get sick?

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,540
The Machinery of War

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,309
Think of yourself as a large country, with a sizable army to defend it.

10
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:46,450
You are surrounded by enemies that want to take your land, your energy, your resources.

11
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,760
This is a matter of life and death, so your body evolved to be sensitive to damage and

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,220
to the presence of enemies.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,790
Because this means that an invasion might happen at any moment and that it has to act

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,790
fast.

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,840
Let us start an invasion and see what happens.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,260
The moment your cells notice that something is off, they release an onslaught of signal

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,900
proteins called cytokines.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,330
They are like air raid sirens that activate all sorts of immune cells, that then themselves

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,970
release many more cytokines, amplifying the alarm.

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,579
Soon you are flooded with signals that trigger precautions and counter-measures.

21
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,979
Mobilization is under way.

22
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,430
Your brain activates sickness behavior and reorganizes your body's priorities to defense.

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,299
The first thing you notice is that your energy level drops and you get sleepy.

24
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,549
You feel apathetic, often anxious or down and you lose your appetite.

25
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,759
Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and you seek out rest.

26
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,840
All of this serves to save your energy and reroute it into your immune response.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,880
You become a country under attack switching into a war economy, because properly activating

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,990
your immune system is intensely disruptive and draining.

29
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,549
Just like war is expensive for a country as industry switches to building tanks, your

30
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,360
immune system demands huge amounts of energy, amino acids and micro elements to build its

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
weapons.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,870
Take fever: it speeds up your metabolism and makes your cells work harder and faster, while

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,099
creating heat that is pretty stressful for many invaders – but it uses up a lot of

34
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,269
calories to maintain.

35
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,450
Then your immune system begins to clone millions of specialized immune cells to respond specifically

36
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,580
to the enemy infecting you.

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,610
B Cells produce millions of antibodies every second, each requiring hundreds of amino acids

38
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,140
to construct.

39
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,850
Billions or even trillions of proteins need to be made to refresh the complement system,

40
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,100
a minefield inside your blood.

41
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,560
Cytokines, the mobilisation and information signals, also need constant refreshing.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,550
Usually you acquire your resources by eating.

43
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,599
But when you are sick, your body slows down your digestion because it needs a lot of energy

44
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,970
you can’t spare.

45
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,480
So it reaches for the easiest source of amino acids and starts breaking down your muscles.

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,170
All that muscle that you worked so hard for is sacrificed to keep you alive.

47
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,960
If you are young and healthy and fit, you will make up for that quickly once you are

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
better.

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,060
But if you are old or very young, weak or suffer from chronic illness, this may be way

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,170
too draining.

51
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,569
Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going.

52
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,701
If your whole system is already strained, when you get sick, just keeping your immune

53
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,910
responses going can overwhelm your capacities.

54
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,870
Your Immune System is a Jerk.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,819
Our enemies too.

56
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,170
Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies.

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,000
There is a very fragile balance between the damage caused by an infection and the collateral

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,349
damage caused by immune cells.

59
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,720
One of your first responders are Neutrophils – imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
guns.

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,629
If a Neutrophil encounters enemies it showers them with chemicals that cut them open but

62
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,091
can also damage civilian cells, especially if the patient is already compromised, for

63
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:01,140
example by smoking.

64
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,300
On top of that the microorganisms that invade you often release chemicals and toxins that

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,040
can cause significant damage and cell death.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,400
So a serious infection often causes many tiny wounds, literally holes in your organs.

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,548
As you can imagine it is not great to have holes and wounds in your organs, and your

68
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,548
body rushes to close them.

69
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:27,220
Your Neutrophils and Macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs,

70
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,430
and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells.

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,220
But others are filled with collagen, a sort of fix-all organic cement that gives your

72
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,130
gooey tissue structural integrity.

73
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,900
You have seen the result on your skin as scars.

74
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,000
A scar is different from the original tissue.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,610
It has no functioning cells in it, it is like a sloppily applied cement patch.

76
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,680
It can’t do what the original tissue was doing.

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,210
A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny bit weaker.

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,150
A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,180
A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter.

80
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,220
And so, as you go through life and survive serious disease after serious disease, the

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,530
functionality of your organs may decrease.

82
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,030
This damage is usually small enough not to affect your quality of life – but can be

83
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,030
permanent.

84
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,590
Ok, this sounds depressing, but there is actually something you can do to avoid a lot of this

85
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,100
damage and train your immune system!

86
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,300
The best way to train your Immune System

87
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,470
Your immune system is unique.

88
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,450
Everyone has a slightly different immune system that’s stronger against some enemies and

89
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,949
weaker against others.

90
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,830
Which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects our species from being wiped out by a single

91
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
infection.

92
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,660
Collectively, the immune system of the human species is a spectrum: most people respond

93
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,960
well enough to an infection, a few are super-responders and a few don't respond well and die.

94
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,030
Some people survived the black death, are more resistant to HIV or Corona virus or even

95
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,730
resistant against Ebola.

96
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,470
Others are killed easily by the flu or highly vulnerable to certain bacterial infections.

97
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,099
Where you are on this spectrum is impossible to predict.

98
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,220
And you also respond differently to every possible infection.

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,289
This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from Covid while for some elderly people

100
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,090
it was more like a mild flu.

101
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,759
The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold is wrong.

102
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,060
You never know what your immune system is good at until it is tested.

103
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,130
Getting sick is a gamble in life’s casino with your health on the line.

104
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,270
Always.

105
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,790
But there is something you can do: hacking one of the best features of your immune system.

106
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,300
When you survive a disease, usually you have better defenses against it afterwards – you

107
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,699
gain memory cells that are very good at killing the specific enemy you fought that day.

108
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,800
So you either don’t get the disease again or the next infection is much milder.

109
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,319
And you can use an incredible achievement of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism

110
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,620
to prevent damage from disease and train your immune system: Vaccines.

111
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,819
Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease and train your defenses to be ready if it

112
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,520
ever shows up for real.

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,770
The goal is to create the same memory cells that you would get after surviving an infection.

114
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,349
But if you can feel some side effects, why should you still do it?

115
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,590
Nature Vs Vaccine Dojo

116
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,940
You have two options to train your immune system: Vaccine Dojo and nature dojo.

117
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,090
In vaccine dojo you train with paper weapons and learn to defend yourself.

118
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,050
Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise.

119
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,110
Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for a few days, but that’s generally it.

120
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,669
No scars, no permanent damage.

121
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:48,370
We discussed vaccine side effects in detail in another video if you want to learn more.

122
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,850
On the other hand, getting a disease to become immune means going to a nature dojo.

123
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:58,530
In nature dojo, you train with real weapons, sharp knives and swords.

124
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,229
Things might still work out, but with way more cuts and wounds.

125
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:08,889
But from time to time someone will die, be it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza.

126
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,419
Nature dojo is just way more risky.

127
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,900
On top of that, the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural

128
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,080
resistance, because they are engineered to engage your immune system in a more productive

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
way.

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,610
Of course vaccines are not magic and sometimes they do not protect us as well as we’d like

131
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,830
them to.

132
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,550
Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly, like the Omicron coronavirus, or because your

133
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,860
specific immune system does not respond well to the vaccine and builds less of a defense.

134
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,809
Still, being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses.

135
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,860
In the end, if we look at the stunning progress humanity has made in the last century, eventually

136
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,620
we may overcome disease for good.

137
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,770
But until then we can do our best to take care of ourselves and others - your body and

138
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,940
your older self will be grateful to you.

139
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,540
Diseases are not the only problem humanity can address if we work together.

140
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,580
We believe the same is true for climate change, one of the main challenges of our generation.

141
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,110
We are very passionate about this topic and we have covered it extensively in previous

142
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,420
videos.

143
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,930
Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different levels of society, from governments and economies

144
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,800
down to the individual.

145
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,130
And there’s one way you can take action now – by working with our friends from Wren,

146
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,750
who help you offset your carbon emissions.

147
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,880
By visiting wren.co and answering a few questions you can find out what your personal carbon

148
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,959
footprint is.

149
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,220
Your first step should be reducing your footprint – but there are limits to that.

150
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,240
Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription that

151
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,519
supports projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from

152
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,519
the sky.

153
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,959
We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate

154
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,990

Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution you’ll get pictures and updates from the

156
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,480
project you support, so you can directly see the impact you are making.

157
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,010
We appreciate Wren’s focus on transparency and impact, so you can always retrace how

158
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,760
your money is spent.

159
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,769
One project we find especially interesting is Refrigerant Destruction — Old refrigerators

160
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,260
use harmful gases as a coolant.

161
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,630
These gases, once released into the atmosphere, cause global warming thousands of times faster

162
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,839
than CO2.

163
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,870
Wren’s project permanently destroys containers filled with these gases—proving, with high

164
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,560
certainty, that they’ll never leak and contribute to global warming.

165
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,990
