1
00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:06,222
Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you are occupying?

2
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:13,544
Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.

3
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:16,196
But… where is all of that?

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:24,013
While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up.

5
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:28,566
In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it.

6
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:35,716
If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left.

7
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:39,655
In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,590
Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.

9
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:47,518
The space we occupy is not like a stage under our feet.

10
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:52,349
We can't mark specific points, or staple something to spacetime as an anchor.

11
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:55,650
Without things there is no position.

12
00:00:55,675 --> 00:01:00,380
We are really ever only at a position in relation to something else.

13
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:06,053
Which also means that things we take for granted, like up and down are actually relative too.

14
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:11,524
Ok, let us fill the universe up with things again and try to find out where you are, right now.

15
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,576
Relative to everything else.

16
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:28,912
Let us start this video at a familiar place and then get increasingly weird.

17
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:33,579
From your perspective the world is seemingly flat and you can move in 3 dimensions.

18
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:36,511
It's what physicists call a 'frame of eference'

19
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:40,616
 - the perspective you have of the universe and how you see things moving around you.

20
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:45,040
Where your up and down is. Your frame of reference is correct.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,015
For you – but not for the rest of the universe.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,159
Around 5 kilometers from you, where the horizon begins, the ground noticeably curves away from you.

23
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:59,551
If you could see through the ground, you’d see people from below or sideways.

24
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:04,664
But they don't fall 'down' off the planet because gravity doesn't actually pull them down.

25
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:11,513
'Down' is an illusion of your reference frame. To earth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in.

26
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:17,251
But for humans there is an up and down because within our frame of reference that just makes sense.

27
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:22,005
Which is also why we think that the planet itself has an up and down, north and south.

28
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:29,151
And we made our maps accordingly. But an observer looking at the solar system might disagree.

29
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:34,267
Our maps make sense to us because we are used to them, not because they are correct.

30
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:40,981
Ok. So this is step one – your position on what feels like a flat surface but is actually a sphere.

31
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:45,061
But this sphere is always moving, never staying in one position.

32
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:49,211
Earth is orbiting a star, the sun at the center of the solar system.

33
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:55,920
While we usually imagine this as pretty orderly, someone looking at us from the outside would see something pretty messy.

34
00:02:55,945 --> 00:03:01,156
To see this more clearly we’ll exaggerate all these movements, this is not to scale.

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,923
First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse,

36
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:10,965
 so we spend half the year sinking a little bit closer to the sun speeding up, and half the year rising up a bit and slowing down.

37
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,696
And the ellipsis itself changes its shape every 100,000 years too.

38
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:21,047
And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the ellipse itself is drifting – which at least creates a beautiful shape.

39
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,084
 – which at least creates a beautiful shape.

40
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,680
In the end, we get an orbital path that looks like a wobbly circle with wavy edges.

41
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:32,951
And it gets worse, as the moon now starts to screw things up too.

42
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:36,863
As the moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on earth.

43
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:44,014
Both objects orbit their common center of gravity, that lies around 4700 km off to the side of Earth’s core.

44
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,695
In practice this means that as the moon orbits earth, it is jerking earth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle.

45
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
Ok so you are standing on the surface of a rotating planet,

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,912
 that is jiggling around the sun in an elliptical orbit that changes a bit every year.

47
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:01,617
But who's to say the earth is right?

48
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:06,071
From the perspective of the sun the plane of the solar system is arbitrary,

49
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:10,924
 it's defined as the plane the earth orbits in because that is convenient for us.

50
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,840
In reality the other planets are just a little bit inclined with respect to our plane.

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,135
From their point of view, we're the ones with a slightly bent orbit.

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,721
But this is not it – far from it!

53
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:27,308
The solar system as a whole is orbiting the center of the milky way galaxy.

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,683
If we look at the milky way, we can clearly make out a galactic plane

55
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:35,766
 in which the solar system orbits the center every 230 million years.

56
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,375
But of course it is not that simple.

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,120
First of all, the plane of the solar system is not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,069
Nothing really is – just like the planets in the solar system orbit the sun on their own planes,

59
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:51,453
 so do all the stars orbiting the galactic center.

60
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,310
The solar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees towards the galactic plane,

61
00:04:56,335 --> 00:05:00,375
 speeding through space at almost a million kilometers per hour.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,554
Someone in the center of the galaxy would see the orbits of the planets moving through space in a helix shape,

63
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:12,055
 which you can imagine as a corkscrew motion, on the tilted plane of the solar system, relative to the plane of the galaxy.

64
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,521
This orientation in space means that sometimes the planets are sort of in front of the sun

65
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:18,988
 as it orbits around the galactic core.

66
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:21,641
Let us just look at this for a moment

67
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:26,661
 – there is a strange and eerie beauty abouthow our planets and the sun move through space.

68
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:30,135
Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse.

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,249
This is still not the whole story because the mass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on the solar system too.

70
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:42,589
Like a drunk dolphin, we're diving down and shooting up hundreds of lightyears through the galactic plane,

71
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:47,495
ten times every orbit, along arcs thousands of light years long.

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,983
We haven’t mapped this motion out completely, as it takes the solar system tens of millions of years to go up and back once;

73
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:57,415
 and, well, humanity is not that old.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,850
Let’s look at your relative position again.

75
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,744
On a planet, tilted towards the sun, jiggled around by the moon.

76
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:11,278
In a solar system tilted towards the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical shape, diving up and down through the plane.

77
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,818
Hm. But where is “up” in a galaxy?

78
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:21,344
At this point the frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary and pointless because of the nature of the universe at this scale.

79
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:27,367
The Milky way is part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of greater structures like the Laniakea Supercluster,

80
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:31,922
 which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex

81
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:39,093
 and finally a galactic filament that spans hundreds of millions of lightyears in all directions and orientations.

82
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:44,959
Someone looking right at us from that far away will only see the End of Greatness.

83
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:48,635
All stuff appears homogeneous, the same everywhere.

84
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,335
Just like with empty space, when everything looks the same, who's to say anyone's view is better than anyone else's?

85
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,920
We have reached the end of our little exercise in cosmic humility.

86
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:01,592
Let us make the journey backwards again.

87
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:07,242
From the indescribably large, to the really large, to our galactic home, to our galaxy,

88
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:11,994
 to the solar system diving up and down through the milky way, to the jiggle of existence.

89
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,495
And finally, back to you, right now, watching this video.

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,792
If this is all a bit much, don’t feel bad.

91
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,267
The scale of the universe is brain crushing

92
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:28,660
and trying to keep track of how everything is oriented or decide where the best up and down is, is hard.

93
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:32,000
But it doesn't really matter. Because it doesn't change where you are.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,223
You're already in the best spot you could possibly be – right here, right now.

95
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:45,642
For all you care nothing can stop you from being right at the center of your own little universe.

96
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,398
Perspective really is everything.

97
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:54,213
That is true for the universe we all inhabit, but even more so within your personal universe.

98
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:59,020
The way your life will unfold also depends on what you consider possible.

99
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:05,908
Take us at Kurzgesagt: our passion is to spark curiosity for science and make videos for free.

100
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:11,680
But this is not a great business model so we began to create our own lines of science posters,

101
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,495
calendars and fun kurzgesagt merch - pieces of Kurzgesagt - that you can take home and touch.

102
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,357
And we are doing this with Shopify, who also were so kind as to sponsor this video

103
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:26,375
 – which delighted us because we have been using their platform for years now.

104
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Shopify is an e-commerce platform that allows you to start and grow your business.

105
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,382
And by starting a business, we really do mean from scratch:

106
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,375
 if you want to sell your handmade ceramic mugs out of your bedroom today, you can.

107
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:43,237
But not just that – if you want to scale your one-man show to a sizeable team,

108
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:46,615
 then Shopify has the tools to support you on your journey.

109
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,678
Now you just have to get started:

110
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:54,162
 go to shopify.com/kurzgesagt to get a free 14 day trial.

111
00:08:54,187 --> 00:09:00,935
If you think that this does not apply to you and your ideas are too small, we want to encourage you to think again:

112
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,117
 the first video on this channel was a university project and Kurzgesagt itself was a creative outlet.

113
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:11,607
Eventually we grew into a business and the team that is making videos for you today.

114
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:15,175
And all of that just because we wanted to try out something new.

115
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,679
This is exactly the sort of thing that Shopify is determined to support and you can build your own thing with it.

116
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:29,283
After all, whetheryour idea is still just a dream or might turn into a plan today is also just a matter of perspective.

117
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:37,078
Millions of businesses in over 175 countries are currently using Shopify to sell their products and we are one of them.

118
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:44,176
Thanks to them for helping us get here and thanks to all of you for making our channel possible.
