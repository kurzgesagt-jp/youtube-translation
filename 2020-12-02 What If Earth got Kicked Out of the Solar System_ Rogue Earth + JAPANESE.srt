1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,541
The night sky seems peaceful and orderly.

2
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:11,071
But in reality, stars are careening through the galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands of kilometers per hour.

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:15,605
Not bound by static formations but changing neighborhoods constantly.

4
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:21,083
Fortunately space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,348
Unfortunately, they don't have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on earth.

6
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:30,896
And there are already stars starting to get very close.

7
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:42,973
To understand how dangerous stars are to us, we need to talk about gravity.

8
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:47,660
Gravity attracts every piece of matter to
every other piece of matter in the universe.

9
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,973
You are attracted by an atom a million light years away and vice versa.

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,706
Luckily, this force gets weaker over distance
and it also depends on how massive something is.

11
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:03,649
So things that are close and are very massive are more attractive, winning the cosmic tug-of-war.

12
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:08,210
This way, massive things define how smaller things behave around them.

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,408
The sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the solar system

14
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:17,291
 and so it shapes the behaviour and orbits of everything else in it.

15
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:22,398
Billions of years ago, after the sun was born the solar system was a chaotic and dangerous place

16
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:26,348
 as the planets were formed from countless little pieces that collided constantly.

17
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:29,370
But over the eons, a stable balance emerged.

18
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:34,273
Today most planets and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable orbits.

19
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,488
We have the inner and outer planets, the asteroid and kuiper belt.

20
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:44,679
And at the edge, the Oort cloud, a giant sphere
of comets orbiting slowly in cold storage.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,453
We really donâ€™t want this balance to be disturbed.

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,108
If another star came too close to us, it's gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like a spoiled toddler,

23
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:59,396
 messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets.

24
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:02,001
This isn't some imaginary danger.

25
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:09,440
Some 70,000 years ago, a red dwarf, brown dwarf binary system, passed through the Oort cloud and messed things up.

26
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,541
It might even have sent a deadly onslaught of asteroids our way.

27
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:19,216
But, it could take two million years until those visitors from the Oort cloud arrive in the inner solar system.

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,338
But there's a much bigger problem on the horizon:

29
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:29,086
Gliese 710, a red dwarf with about half the mass of the sun, is currently headed towards the solar system.

30
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:35,173
In about a million years it'll pass through the Oort cloud and become the brightest star in the night sky.

31
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:39,651
A close flyby like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years,

32
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:44,155
 disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the Oort cloud considerably.

33
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:50,260
If we are unlucky, it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment, similar to the early solar system.

34
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:55,660
The night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids raining down on the inner solar system.

35
00:02:56,033 --> 00:03:02,083
The larger ones could cause Dinosaur level mass extinctions and would be bad for the stock market.

36
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:09,585
But it could get much worse. The galaxy is an intense place and stars get close to each other regularly.

37
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:17,108
So it is possible that a star could come much closer and not just pass us but fly directly through the inner solar system.

38
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:19,856
This would be very bad in the extreme.

39
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:27,651
The chance of another star colliding with the sun is astronomically unlikely, but that isn't what we're worried about.

40
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:34,670
If another star were to pass by about as close as the earth is from the sun, it could easily eject the earth from the solar system.

41
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:41,496
The odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1/100,000 in the next five billion years.

42
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,358
Small, but not absurdly so.

43
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:48,445
As we discussed in another video, there seem to be billions of rogue planets,

44
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:52,186
doing their own thing in the galaxy and this is one way to make them.

45
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,393
So if this were to happen with an average red dwarf, what would happen on earth?

46
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:00,286
Kicking Earth out of the Solar System

47
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:05,518
As the star enters the solar system a small orangish dot appears in the sky

48
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:10,141
 that grows bigger and brighter for months, eventually becoming visible during the day.

49
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,625
It would get bigger and much brighter than the moon.

50
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:16,168
Too bright to look at directly.

51
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,611
The night sky would be filled with an eerie red glow.

52
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,661
After a few months it would start shrinking again.

53
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,365
But so would the sun.

54
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,965
Over a few years, the sun slowly grows smaller in the sky,

55
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:31,411
 and with it warmth and light start to dissipate.

56
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:37,243
All around the world, as the days turn dark, the final winter of humanity would begin.

57
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:42,748
The polar ice caps begin to grow and spread while plants shrivel and die.

58
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:46,595
Forrests freeze and animals die in droves.

59
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:53,253
As the earth passes the orbit of Mars the average surface temperature has plummeted to near -50 C.

60
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:56,720
From space, earth begins to look like an icy moon,

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,290
the blue-green surface becoming the pale grey-white of death.

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,663
As global infrastructure breaks down, people huddle together indoors,

63
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:09,300
 burning what they can for warmth as the temperature continues to drop,

64
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:13,575
 counting the days until they'll be out of food which no longer grows.

65
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,700
Everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time.

66
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:24,195
By the time earth reaches Jupiter's orbit surface temperatures sink to -150 C,

67
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:28,033
 lower than the coldest ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica.

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,659
Needless to say by now almost everyone is dead.

69
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:39,320
Without the energy from sunlight to evaporate water, clouds don't form and the water cycle stops.

70
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,540
The polar ice caps eventually touch at the equator, and the oceans become covered in a thick layer of ice.

71
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:50,691
As more and more of its heat leaks out more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet;

72
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:56,133
 the concentration of salt in the deep ocean grows, poisoning most animals that survived here.

73
00:05:56,549 --> 00:06:03,090
Although around hydrothermal vents communities of extremophiles might adapt even to these circumstances.

74
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:07,600
Deep below the surface some bacteria would not notice much of any of this,

75
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,349
 as they are still kept warm by the radioactive decay of elements in the earth's core.

76
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:18,571
As the earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the Kuiper belt the sun is still the brightest star in the sky,

77
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:22,650
 but it is one among many, with stars now visible during the day.

78
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:26,978
The temperature is now barely 40 C above absolute zero,

79
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:30,613
 below the freezing temperature of the gasses in the atmosphere.

80
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:34,831
A weird spectacle, enjoyed by no one unfortunately,

81
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:39,588
 unfolds as the atmosphere turns into Nitrogen and then oxygen snow.

82
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:45,358
Over a few years it is deposited into an icy 10 meter thick sheet all over the planet's surface,

83
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:48,123
 with only a thin whisper of gas remaining.

84
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,493
The frozen corpses of flora and fauna are buried beneath them.

85
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:56,623
As earth leaves the solar system it becomes a rogue planet.

86
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:02,289
Traveling alone through the dark.
Lifeless and in solitude.

87
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,386
But weirdly enough, there is hope.

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Humanity would not be surprised by this potential extinction event.

89
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,918
We'd notice it thousands of years in advance.

90
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:17,053
There is not a lot we could do to stop a star.
But we could prepare.

91
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,661
Most of us would perish.
But a few million could survive in huge artificial complexes,

92
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:29,400
 powered by geothermal and nuclear energy, possibly even fusion if we can learn to use the ice around us for power.

93
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:33,650
Here humanity might survive for hundreds of thousands of years.

94
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:40,361
At some point we would become used to our circumstances and new generations would watch documentaries in disbelief,

95
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:44,816
 about the time we had our own star and could walk the surface of earth.

96
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,763
And at some point we might decide to look for another home.

97
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:54,581
If the earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet, we could try to make a fresh start.

98
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:59,300
Spaceflight, oddly enough, would become very easy without the atmosphere in the way.

99
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,859
So it's not unthinkable that the last survivors would leave earth behind and try again on a new planet, around a new star.

100
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:14,410
Maybe one day, thousands of years later, the descendants of humanity will tell legends about earth's ancient past.

101
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,961
Stories of our lost home.

102
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:24,776
Of a mysterious icy planet, floating alone and empty through the dark of space.

103
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:30,823
So basically the key to humanity's survival is learning about what we'll be dealing with.

104
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:37,873
Well, we'd better get cracking then.
