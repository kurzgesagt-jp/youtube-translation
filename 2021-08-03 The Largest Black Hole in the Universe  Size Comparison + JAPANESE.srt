1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,000
The largest things in the 
universe are black holes.  

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,640
In contrast to things like planets or 
stars they have no physical size limit,  

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,240
and can literally grow endlessly. Although in 
reality specific things need to happen to create  

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,760
different kinds of black holes, from really tiny 
ones to the largest single things in the universe.  

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:29,840
So how do black holes grow and how 
large is the largest of them all?

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,520
This video will not discuss how black holes work 
or how they form since we’ve looked at that in  

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,040
detail in our black hole and neutron star series, 
you can check them out afterwards. For now we are  

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,880
interested in finding the largest thing in the 
universe. Let us start really, really small.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
Primordial Black holes

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,760
The smallest kind of black holes may or may not 
exist. If they do, they are probably the oldest  

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,840
objects in the universe, older even than atoms. 
They would have formed just after the big bang,  

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
when the universe was so dense with 
violent energy, that any tiny pocket  

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
that was just slightly more dense than 
its neighbors could produce a black hole.

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,480
The smallest Primordial Black Hole that 
could still be around would be a trillion  

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,080
kilograms or so, the mass of a big mountain. 
And yet they would be no bigger than a proton.  

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
A Primordial Black hole with the mass of 
earth would barely be larger than a coin.  

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,480
This makes them very hard to find, so we 
haven’t actually observed any yet – if  

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,840
they exist they may even be the mysterious 
dark matter that holds galaxies together.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
Let’s move on to the kinds of black holes 
that we know for sure ARE out there.

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,720
Stellar Black Holes

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,240
To make a black hole we need to compress enough 
matter so that it collapses into itself. After  

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,440
that, the more mass we throw at it, the 
larger it becomes. In today's universe,  

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,240
only the most violent cosmic events can create 
the necessary conditions, such as the merger of  

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,080
neutron stars or when the core of a very massive 
star collapses in a supernova. To have a unit to  

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,680
work with here, we’ll use the mass of our sun, 
about 2 million trillion trillion kilograms.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,880
The smallest known black hole 
has 2.7 times the mass of the sun  

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,080
which works out as a sphere around 16 km 
in diameter, large enough to cover Paris.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,480
Another lightweight black hole is the 
companion to the V723 Mon red giant star.  

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,200
This star is 24 times larger than our sun, 
30 million kilometer in diameter. And yet,  

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,160
it is thrown around by a tiny black hole 
just 17.2 km wide. This tiny thing bullying  

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,480
the star is so much smaller that we can 
barely even show them in comparison.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,720
One of the largest known stellar black holes is 
M33 X-7. It currently spends its time eating a 70  

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,640
solar mass blue giant, bit by bit. As all that 
stolen matter circles towards the black hole,  

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,120
like water going down a drain, friction heats 
it up to temperatures high enough to shine  

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,200
500,000 times brighter than our Sun! And 
yet, X-7 is ‘only’ 15.65 solar masses  

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,600
and 92 km wide, just big enough 
to cast a shadow on Corsica.

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,560
To grow much larger, black holes have to either 
devour a lot of stars or better, merge with one  

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
another. The instruments that make it possible 
to detect these mergers are very new so we are  

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
currently discovering a lot of exciting things. 
Like two massive black holes that we detected in  

40
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,080
a galaxy 17 billion lightyears away. As they spun 
around each other violently, they released more  

41
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,520
energy in the form of gravitational waves than the 
combined light from all the stars in the milky way  

42
00:03:51,520 --> 00:04:00,480
in 4400 years. The new black hole they formed is 
about the size of Germany and is 142 solar masses.

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,160
And here we hit a curious gap in scale.

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,800
There are lots of black holes up to 150 solar 
masses. And then there is nothing for a long  

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,560
time. Until we suddenly hit black holes, 
that are millions of times more massive.

46
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
Which is a bit confusing, because we had this 
idea that black holes are consistently growing  

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,520
and growing. But for the most massive black holes 
this process is not fast enough to explain their  

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,400
existence today. The universe is simply not 
old enough for these supermassive black holes  

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,120
to have formed by eating stars and merging with 
each other. Something else must have happened.

50
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,920
To explain how we got the largest black 
holes in the universe, we might need the  

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,160
largest stars that ever existed: Quasi Stars. 
To get a sense of scale, we can compare them  

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,920
to the largest stars that exist today. Our 
Sun is like a grain of sand next to them.

53
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,080
We don’t know if Quasi Stars actually existed but 
they are an interesting concept when it comes to  

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,920
supercharging black hole development. The idea is 
that the matter in the early universe was so dense  

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,280
that quasi stars could grow to thousands of 
times the mass of our sun. The cores of these  

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,480
stars might have been crushed by their own weight 
so much to actually collapse into black holes  

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,840
while the star was still forming. In contrast to 
stars today that would destroy themselves in the  

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,840
process, inside quasi stars, a deadly balance 
could emerge. Gravity pressed the supermassive  

59
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,720
star together, feeding the black hole and heating 
the material falling in to such a degree that the  

60
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,160
radiation pressure kept the star stable. And so 
these quickly growing black holes might have been  

61
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,600
able to consume the quasi star for millions of 
years and grow far bigger than any modern stellar  

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,160
black hole. Black holes several thousand times the 
mass of the Sun and wider than the entire earth.

63
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
These black holes might have become 
the seeds for supermassive black holes.

64
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,640
Supermassive black holes

65
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,680
So now, we arrive at the kings of our 
universe, the largest single bodies in  

66
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,480
existence. The centers of most galaxies contain a 
super massive black hole, and they are monstrous.

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,080
In the Milky Way we have Sagittarius A 
Star, a super massive black hole with  

68
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,000
about 4 million solar masses that is calm and 
collected and just does its thing. We know  

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,120
it sits there because we can see a number of stars 
being thrown around by a seemingly empty spot.  

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,440
And despite its incredible 
mass, it’s radius is still  

71
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,560
only 17 times our sun. Smaller than most giant 
stars, but millions of times more massive.

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,480
Because Supermassive black holes are so 
massive and located at the center of galaxies,  

73
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,120
many people imagine them as being a bit like 
the Sun in the solar system. An anchor that  

74
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,440
glues everything else together and forces it into 
an orbit. But this is a misconception. While the  

75
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,960
sun makes up 99.86% of all the mass in the solar 
system, SuperMassive Black Holes usually only have  

76
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,560
0.001% of the mass of their galaxy. The billions 
of stars in galaxies are not gravitationally  

77
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,520
bound to them, instead it is the gravitational 
effect of dark matter which holds them together.

78
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,200
Many supermassive black holes aren’t gentle 
giants, especially when they are feeding on  

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,360
the clouds of mass in their galaxy. The one at the 
center of the BL Lacertae galaxy is devouring so  

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,840
much material that it produces jets of plasma 
accelerated to nearly the speed of light.  

81
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,120
If Earth were orbiting this huge body, it would 
seem 115 times larger than our Sun in the sky…  

82
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,200
and we’d be burnt to a crisp in seconds 
by its glowing hot accretion disk.

83
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,600
At this point black holes become so large that 
stars seem ridiculously tiny compared to them.

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:57,040
The galaxy Cygnus A has a super massive black hole 
with 2.5 billion solar masses and 14.7 billion km  

85
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,760
wide, which would mean that if it took the place 
of our Sun, it would swallow all the planets and  

86
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,320
stretch halfway to the edge of our Solar System. 
It is devouring so much mass and material that it  

87
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,640
churns its disk into a kind of magnetic funnel, 
spewing gas out making tremendous radio lobes,  

88
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:21,760
towering over the galaxy, half a million light 
years in diameter. That is 2.5 Milkyways wide.

89
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Another pretty large Super Massive Black 
hole sits in the galaxy Messier 87. It  

90
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,159
has 6.5 billion solar masses and was the 
first black hole we got an actual photo of.  

91
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,799
Or rather of the glowing gas around 
the edge of a menacing shadow.  

92
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,800
This sphere of darkness is so large 
that it covers our entire Solar System.

93
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,600
And yet, there is a scale even 
above these kinds of objects...

94
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,840
Ultramassive black holes

95
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,040
Now we reach the most massive black holes, perhaps 
the largest single bodies that will ever exist.  

96
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,120
These black holes have eaten so much that they've 
grown to tens of billions of solar masses, their  

97
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,720
gravity the engine for a ‘quasar’- an accretion 
disk shining brighter than thousands of galaxies  

98
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,800
full of stars. So massive that they deserve a 
title of their own - Ultramassive Black Holes.

99
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:27,040
The Ultra Massive Black Hole at the center of 
galaxy OJ 287 is 18 billion solar masses. It  

100
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,120
is so big that it has a Super Massive black hole, 
nearly forty times larger than sagittarius A star,  

101
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,560
orbiting it! This thing defies imagination 
and is really hard to compare to anything.  

102
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,680
It can comfortably fit three Solar 
Systems side by side inside of it.

103
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,040
Let us end this insane competition 
and get to the king of kings.

104
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,560
TON 618, a black hole that we can observe 
consuming galaxies worth of matter is  

105
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,320
shining with the brightness of a hundred trillion 
stars, visible from 18 billion light years away.  

106
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,680
It has an incredible 66 billion solar masses. 
A black hole so large that it would take light  

107
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
a week to reach the singularity after 
crossing the event horizon. About 11  

108
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Solar Systems could sit inside of it side 
by side. It may very well be the largest  

109
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,480
single body in the universe. But in 
reality, it is probably even larger.  

110
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,800
Since TON 618 is so far away, we only see 
what it looked like 10 billion years ago.

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,760
In any case, black holes are scary and mysterious  

112
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,400
and gigantic. They will be here after everything 
else dies, and growing larger and larger.

113
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,480
So now let us do the trip again. From 
the smallest possible black hole,  

114
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:59,840
all the way up to the largest.

115
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,840
Let’s try something new today, 
we can call it: “Behind the Lies”  

116
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,320
a short behind the scenes bit about the 
necessary inaccuracies in this video  

117
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,880
because it's really not actually possible 
to rank black holes like trading cards.

118
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,240
How so? Well, while we have catalogued 
millions of stars, we really only have  

119
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,440
good data on a couple of dozen black holes. 
That’s because black hole gazing wasn’t really  

120
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,400
a thing until 50 years ago – and technically 
still isn’t, because we can’t see black holes.

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,640
We can only derive their properties from studying 
their gravitational effects on the matter around  

122
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,680
them, like the orbit of stars that come close 
to them. This effect depends on the mass of the  

123
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,600
black hole, which we can approximate at 
the most basic level with Kepler’s Laws.  

124
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
But this comes with huge 
uncertainties and error bars.  

125
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,080
Then we have to convert mass to size 
next, which brings new uncertainties.  

126
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,040
For example, we calculated the radius from the 
mass using the Schwarzschild equation which for  

127
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,560
the sake of simplicity assumes black holes are 
perfectly round and don’t spin: a kind of black  

128
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,040
hole that doesn’t really exist. The reality is 
that physics on these scales is a bit fuzzy.

129
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600
So some of the black holes we talked about 
here may be way smaller or way bigger. We  

130
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,640
just don’t know for sure. We shimmied around 
this problem by comparing different sources  

131
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,720
with different kinds of values and using 
different mass calculations to arrive  

132
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
at a standardized list that allowed us 
to be as accurate as humanly possible.  

133
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,320
You can look at all of this in our source doc. As 
a result this script was written with the tears of  

134
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,960
experts we drove crazy with our obsession 
for the best values they could live with.

135
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,120
In this process, tons of stuff 
got cut and didn’t make it into  

136
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,880
the final video – but luckily we 
found a way to not waste all of it:

137
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,080
We created a lot of black hole merch, spanning the 
whole range from somewhat bonkers to more serious.  

138
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,440
This way we get to explore a topic 
from different angles – and you  

139
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:33,840
get to continue having fun with 
black holes after this video ends.
