1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,780
In the 1970s thousands of Chickenheads rained from the sky in Europe,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,340
making foxes and other wildlife confused 

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,940
and very happy.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,230
Why?

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,900
They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity – 

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,220
since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,010
and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all. 

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,830
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage, 

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,570
and has been haunting us for at least 4000 years. 

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,100
It can turn animals into angry beasts 

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,140
and humans into zombies that fear water.


12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,310
But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is, 

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,380
but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses. 

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,650
Viruses exist on the edge between life and death,

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,340
hardly more than a few genetic instructions that need living cells to multiply. 

16
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,600
The lyssavirus is simple even for a virus: 

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,860
It has only five genes, that is the instructions for five proteins that it's sold complex problems.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,400
Infect a mammal, avoid its immune system, 

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,370
travel to its brain, make more of itself and infect new hosts. 

20
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,320
Let's see what happens if you get infected

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,120
It all starts with a bite, most likely by a dog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva, pushing them deep into the tissue.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,550
The goal is your nerve cells, your neurons. 

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,950
They are living electrochemical wires, transferring signals throughout your body,

24
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,840
and can stretch for up to 1.5 meters, with their cellular machinery on one end and a terminal on the other. 

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,220
The terminal is where cells talk to each other, by passing chemicals that convey information.   

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,070
Lyssa probably binds to the receptors that are crucial for this process 

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,740
and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells. 

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,560
Inside, the virus has to solve a big problem. 

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,220
that needs to get to the cellular Machinery to take over the cell and make more viruses

30
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,930
and because neurons are pretty long, this can be far away. 

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,700
There is a solution at hand though: 

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,590
Cells have microtubules spanning their insides that give them structural integrity.  

33
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,290
But they also provide a track system for a specialized delivery system: 

34
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,200
Dynein motors are actual motors that use energy and deliver packages.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,950
They are made from 50 different proteins, ten times more than the virus, 

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,570
and look like a little pair of shoes. 

37
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,300
Lyssa uses one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing system

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,410
and order it to head for the nucleus. 

39
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,350
What is the immune system doing to prevent all of that? 

40
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,580
Well, unfortunately not much. 
41
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,140
Usually when a virus attacks your civilian cells are crucial in activating your immune response.   

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,440
They notice that they have been infected and release hundreds of thousands of a special family of proteins: 

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,420
The interferons that, well, interfere with viruses. 

44
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,800
We’ll have to simplify a lot, but in a nutshell, Interferons alert your immune system to make antivirus weapons.   
45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,050
But they do much more: they tell civilian cells to turn down their protein factories for a while –
46
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,570
which means that viruses can’t replicate efficiently anymore. 

47
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,120
And interferons tell your cells to become super transparent, 

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,430
which is important, because how can your immune cells notice that your civilian cells are infected when viruses hide inside them? 

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,360
Your body solves this by creating display windows into their insides, 

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,690
 called MHC class I molecules.

51
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,550
Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive, and to showcase to your immune cells what is going on inside them

52
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,710
they take random samples of their products and put them into these tiny display windows to give a peek inside. 

53
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,950
Interferon tells your cells to make WAY more display windows and become super transparent.  

54
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:01,850
If a cell is infected and forced to make virus parts, your immune cells will see these parts in a window and order the infected cell to kill itself

55
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,690
– and all the viruses trapped within.

56
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,100
This is one of the most powerful methods of wiping out a viral infection. 

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:16,310
Unfortunately Lyssa blocks your neurons from making interferons and stays basically invisible to your immune system. 

58
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,410
In contrast to many other viruses, when it replicates, it doesn’t kill its host, 

59
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,090
which would also trigger alarm systems.   

60
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:31,070
Instead it stealthily jumps from neuron to neuron, very slowly making its way to your brain. 

61
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,860
This phase can take weeks to months and very rarely even years

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,500
and depends on a bunch of things, like if the bite was in your face or foot or how many viruses got into your muscles. 

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,520
Lyssa is a patient monster. 

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,350
Until it reaches its goal: Your brainstem. 

65
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,870
Finally, the immune system catches on that something isn’t right and reacts.

66
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,820
It dispatches some of your most powerful antivirus cells, Killer T Cells, 

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,530
to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the enemy.

68
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,910
In other viral infections this would be a turning point, but in rabies the T cells are rushing towards their doom. 

69
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,210
Simple Lyssa with its 5 proteins 

70
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,270
plays a uno reverse card, using the immune system’s ingenuity against itself.

71
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,620
Your central nervous system is a very fragile part of your body

72
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,560
and so the immune system has to be very careful.

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,470
A few haywire immune cells in your brain is a quick way to die.  

74
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,510
So they aren’t free to enter your nervous system, they have to be invited in and can be kicked out. 

75
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:37,990
To protect themselves, your nerve cells can order T Cells to self-destruct, if they think they are overreacting. 

76
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,400
And Lyssa figured out a way to make infected neurons express this order.

77
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,190
So as your powerful defense cells arrive –

78
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,150
they are ordered to commit suicide. 

79
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,170
Now the virus infiltrates the brain stem. 

80
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,140
Once this stage is reached you are going to die. 

81
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,860
How Lyssa Kills 

82
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,510
One of the most irritating things about the Lyssavirus 

83
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,370
is that we still don’t know exactly how and why an infected person dies. 

84
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,660
Our usual idea of viruses causing damage is by multiplying rapidly, 

85
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,380
killing their host cells once they have made enough copies

86
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,660
triggering a massive immune reaction that also does a lot of damage.

87
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,090
But this doesn’t seem to be what happens here.   

88
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,850
Brain tissue of rabies patients shows minimal, sometimes non-existent damage.  

89
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,040
Instead of murdering everything in sight, 

90
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,530
it is currently thought that lyssa wreaks havoc by messing up the neuron communication inside your brain,

91
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,640
so much so, that it can’t function anymore. 

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,700
this leads to symptoms like confusion, aggression and paralysis.  
93
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,860
Now the virus begins to leave.

94
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,590
Still traveling through neurons, it migrates away from the brain and heads for the salivary glands. 

95
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,120
This is remarkable, because after traveling in one direction the virus reverses its course.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,300
After decades of study we don’t know how this works.   
97
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,150
Lyssa ends up saturating your saliva ready for the irate mammal to bite another and repeat the cycle. 

98
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,040
While this seems like the beginning of a Zombie outbreak, 

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,710
luckily there are no known cases of a human biting another and spreading rabies this way. 

100
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,860
Now the end is near.

101
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,280
You are rapidly developing encephalitis,

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,140
a swelling of the brain with many unpleasant neurological symptoms, from lethargy to paralysis. 

103
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,120
Slowly at first, and then suddenly, organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma. 

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,240
There is no known effective therapy, 

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,900
barely anyone has ever survived Lyssa once symptoms begin to show. 

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,400
It is by far the deadliest virus we know. 

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,660
Except, there is actually something that could save you 

108
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,910
 – a vaccine.   

109
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,960
Rabies was one of the first diseases humans developed a vaccine for.   
110
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,930
As vaccines do, it prepares your immune system for a future attack, 

111
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,900
so it has the right weapons ready in high numbers.

112
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,640
The horrific tricks of simple Lyssa don’t work once you are vaccinated. 

113
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,850
And the vaccine is special for another reason

114
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:08,180
– because Lyssa is so slow in the first few weeks, it can be given to you after you have been exposed. 

115
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,720
So you can still be vaccinated after you have been bitten by an animal. 

116
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,170
Which is super important if you’ve had contact with a sick wild animal, say a bat, 

117
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,880
because you often don’t even notice a bite from tiny teeth. 

118
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,980
Rabies is a monster. 

119
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,520
One that has followed our species around for thousands of years, 

120
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,630
that our ancestors were terrified of and rightly so. 

121
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,480
It still kills around 60,000 people each year, 

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,770
almost half of them children. 

123
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,430
We are far from eradicating this monster – 

124
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,360
It lurks in the shadows, in forests and animals of all kinds, ready to return in greater numbers

125
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,100
if we ever forget how to keep it at bay, or if we continue the trend of being suspicious of vaccines. 

126
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,900
Let us hope that one day humanity slays this monster, 

127
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,550
it can become like most monsters: Part of our imagination. 

128
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,100
There are much deeper levels of knowledge to explore about rabies than the glimpse we just showed you. 

129
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,480
But digging into sources and scientific information on your own can be intimidating

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:19,320
So we partnered with our friends from Brilliant to create an interactive course with hands-on lessons to guide you through some of the concepts we showed in this video.   

131
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,930
Brilliant is an interactive learning tool with over 60 courses in math, science, and computer science. 

132
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,580
They make science accessible with a hands-on approach.   

133
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,650
Think of it as a one-on-one tutoring version of a Kursgesagt video.

134
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,020
You’ll experiment with how fast the virus can reach your brain based on its protein makeup 

135
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,020
or run simulations on Rabies’ genetic evolution,

136
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,730
to explore how mutations created the deadly virus we know today. 

137
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,890
You can do things like manipulate energy to see how black holes are formed, 

138
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:52,640
or control the expansion of space itself to determine the ultimate fate of the universe. 

139
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
To get some behind-the-scenes-science-coaching on space and biology and many more topics,

And there’s an extra perk for kurzgesagt viewers:

142
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:12,220

143
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,480
We love to go down a rabbit hole with our research – Brilliant will take you by the hand to come along on the ride. 

144
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,460
Nature isn't always scary

145
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,300
it can also be beautiful

146
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:34,490
nature holds many small treasures

147
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,300
and beautiful moments in everyday life

148
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,700
from the tiniest of living things

149
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,380
