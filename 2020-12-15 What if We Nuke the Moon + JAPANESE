1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,430
What would happen if we were to detonate a
very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon?

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,970
Would the explosion knock its orbit towards
earth, causing tidal waves and misery? Could

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:20,890
the moon be destroyed, showering the earth
in a rain of meteoric death?

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:30,999
During the cold war the moon was a major target
for space exploration and you know, military

5
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:36,809
bases. So the US Air Force commissioned a
serious study into the effects of a nuclear

6
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,160
detonation on the surface of the moon. But
just quoting stuff is boring, so let’s conduct

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,300
a very important scientific experiment with
an imaginary 100 megaton thermonuclear warhead,

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,670
about twice as powerful as the most powerful
bomb ever detonated. We’ll also place a

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,850
number of curious astronauts around the moon
as observers.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,099
Let’s push the button and slow down time.
For the first few milliseconds nothing much

11
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:10,800
happens outside our weapon. Meanwhile inside,
high explosives send a shockwave to a radioactive

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,520
metal core, compressing it so much that it
reaches criticality and starts a nuclear fission

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,619
chain reaction. The 100 million degree plasma
created in this first stage sets off the second

14
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,611
stage, with atomic nuclei fusing like they
do in the core of a star. Very briefly, our

15
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:34,509
weapon contains one of the hottest places
in the universe. And only now, barely ten

16
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:39,390
milliseconds later, does the rest of the universe
find out that anything has happened, as suddenly

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,689
the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear
death is born.

18
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,490
So far so good. But everything that happens
now is very different from what we’re used

19
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,430
to on earth because of one major difference:
There’s no atmosphere.

20
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,799
As the fireball shines it releases a flash
of X-rays and thermal photons, a wave of silent

21
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,729
heat which rushes outwards in all directions.
On earth, this heat would char and burn everything

22
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,780
within a 50 kilometer radius at least. But
on the moon, without an atmosphere and oxygen-rich

23
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,530
air, there’s no burning at all. Also there
are no things to burn. The crunchy topsoil

24
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,860
of the moon is made from silicate rock and
metals chewed to dust by eons of meteorite

25
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,920
impacts, mixed with tiny traces of water.
When heated by the explosion, X-rays from

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,010
the fireball vaporize a thin cloud of rock
from the lunar surface, while the unlucky

27
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,540
dust that’s inside the fireball melts into
glass. Any astronauts watching the show within

28
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,420
about 50 km can expect to be fried.

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,820
And now, we begin to see one of the biggest
differences between explosions in space and

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,810
on earth. On earth the atmosphere fights back
against the plasma bubble: Its expansion is

31
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,760
violently stopped within moments by the pressure
of the atmosphere. But this is not good news.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,840
As the fireball rams the atmosphere it produces
the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,430
on earth: the shockwave. Compressed air around
the explosion rushes out faster than the speed

34
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,620
of sound, shattering buildings and roaring
so loud it ruptures organs. But on the moon

35
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,850
there is no shockwave. No atmosphere means
nothing to impede the expanding explosion

36
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,480
in space. On the moon, the fireball just grows
in eerie silence as there is no atmosphere

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,400
to stop it or to give it a voice.

38
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,980
This would be an amazing thing to watch from
a safe distance. Unfortunately there’s hardly

39
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,240
any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion
on the moon. Without an atmosphere weakening

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,340
the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble
DNA, anyone close enough to get a good look

41
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,800
will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation.
But of course, that’s not all.

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,690
While all of this happens the explosion hammers
against the moon, transferring about a tenth

43
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,580
of the explosion energy into seismic waves,
powering an intense moonquake. The moon is

44
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,320
much smaller than the earth, and our astronauts
will feel an inescapable violent shaking no

45
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,569
matter where they’re standing. Compared
to an earthquake of 7 on the Richter scale,

46
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,080
this shaking could seriously damage or even
level infrastructure we might have built anywhere

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,329
on the moon. Those who hid on the far side
of the moon would have no idea it was an explosion,

48
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,939
the quaking would feel like an asteroid the
size of the Great Pyramid had struck.

49
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:28,580
And it’s not over yet: Where our bomb explodes,
the ground splatters like water when a rock

50
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,639
strikes a pond. As the explosion pushes against
the surface it may excavate as much as a hundred

51
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,020
million cubic meters of dust and rock, forming
a crater a kilometer across while bedrock

52
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,110
is pulverized to rubble. Debris is shot into
the sky in every direction.

53
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,350
Again without an atmosphere there’s no drag
to slow any of it down. Much of the debris

54
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,009
scattered never returns to the moon, flying
off faster than escape velocity. A flurry

55
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,990
of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore
the solar system, many of which will rain

56
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,819
down on the earth, though few will be larger
than pebbles. Any satellite, astronaut or

57
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,800
space station in the way though will have
a really bad time.

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,520
Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds
and angles, allowing them to spread all over

59
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,240
the surface of the moon. Like bullets they’ll
punch through our curious astronauts no matter

60
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,210
where they stand.

61
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:30,150
Finally, our explosion comes to an end. On
earth, the fireball rises like a hot air balloon

62
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,060
forming a sort of stalk; as it reaches up
cooler air is drawn in around it, rounding

63
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,550
the top into a mushroom cloud. But on the
moon, well, you know by now: no atmosphere,

64
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,169
no mushroom. The larger the plasma gets, the
cooler it becomes, and the less energy it

65
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,759
has to make interesting or terrifying things
happen. Within seconds of pulling the trigger,

66
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,050
the bubble reddens and fades from view. It
would be visible from the earth, like a star

67
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,770
flickering to life only to fade out right
away. A spark, and then nothing. As the cloud

68
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,319
of tiny debris reaches far above the surface
of the moon, it’s illuminated by the sun

69
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,599
for a few minutes giving it an eerie beauty
for anyone left to observe the spectacle.

70
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,240
What about the moon’s orbit? It is basically
unchanged. Trying to move the moon with a

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,950
nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing
on it. Nuclear explosions may be big, but

72
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:32,160
space is bigger. Our mighty explosion just
leaves another crater. One among millions.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,650
Still, anyone on the moon will continue to
not enjoy themselves. The material that ends

74
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,880
up raining back to the moon is radioactive,
and without any natural processes to wash

75
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,430
it away or bury it, the surface of the moon
will remain contaminated. Although fortunately,

76
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,600
the worst of the radiation will have decayed
to a level comparable to natural levels from

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,440
cosmic rays in about a year.

78
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,909
In conclusion we can say with confidence that
while the moon itself does not care about

79
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:04,249
being nuked and will barely notice, using
the moon as a nuclear test ground kind of

80
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:09,181
ruins it for everyone trying to spend some
time there or to build something useful. So

81
00:07:09,181 --> 00:08:28,659
maybe we should just not 
do that.
