1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,836
Black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:08,060
and they are wildly weird and complicated.

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:12,746
What would happen if you fell inside one and what are they really?

4
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:23,476
First we need to talk about space and time:

5
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:29,169
Space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe unfolds.

6
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:35,308
But space isn't a fixed stage and time doesn't tick the same for everyone everywhere.

7
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:37,818
In short, they are relative.

8
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:43,765
Matter bends space and bent space tells matter how to move.

9
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,408
Put some stars and planets on the stage, and it sags underneath them.

10
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:54,146
That misshapen stage, with all its little warps and dips, gives us gravity.

11
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:59,256
Black holes do not just bend the stage, they are like trap doors.

12
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:04,201
Places with so much mass that the universe formed a 'no-go' zone

13
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:06,526
where the rules change.

14
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:10,875
Most black holes form when very massive stars die.

15
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:15,586
We explained this process in detail in our neutron star video

16
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:19,878
– all you need to know now, that in the final moments of really massive stars,

17
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:24,143
their insides implode, at nearly a quarter of the speed of light.

18
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:29,575
This packs so much mass, so close together that it creates something so dense

19
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,763
that it sort of breaks the stage of the universe.

20
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:38,663
A black hole with ten times the mass of the sun would be barely 60 kilometers across.

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,143
If you look directly at a black hole it looks like... nothing.

22
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,598
The space under their control is blocked by an invisible,

23
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:49,832
one-way border called the event horizon.

24
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:53,163
The event horizon forms a shell around a region of space that,

25
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:57,679
once entered, is shielded from the rest of the universe forever.

26
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:03,728
Because the black hole trap door deforms space so much, not even light can escape it.

27
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:10,336
And with nothing escaping to transfer information from the inside, it's impossible to tell what it really looks like.

28
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:14,413
We still can observe black holes because of their effect on matter.

29
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:19,300
Things can orbit black holes just as they can orbit the sun or a planet.

30
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:24,235
Many black holes have discs of matter orbiting outside the event horizon.

31
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,871
This matter can become incredibly hot

32
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:30,748
as close orbits can speed this matter up to half the speed of light,

33
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:36,059
and tiny amounts of friction and collisions between particles heat them to a billion degrees,

34
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:41,396
making the space around these black holes, ironically, incredibly bright.

35
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:46,403
What would happen if you would try to get close, or even inside a black hole?

36
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:50,866
First of all, you would see the strangest funhouse mirror in the universe.

37
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:53,718
Matter isn't the only thing orbiting a black hole:

38
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:57,868
gravity is so strong near them that light can orbit too.

39
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:01,955
If you hovered just outside the event horizon, at the photon sphere,

40
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,501
in any direction you'd just see... yourself!

41
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:11,988
Straight ahead would be the back of your own head, as light from your back travels around the black hole to your eyes.

42
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:15,561
Gravity also alters the passage of time itself.

43
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:18,960
The stronger the gravity, the slower time passes.

44
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:24,800
While you watch the universe above you speed up, those far away will watch you in slow motion.

45
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:31,094
If you chose to fly away from the black hole, you might find that eons have passed for the rest of the universe,

46
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:37,386
a freakish one-way time-travel trip to the future where your loved ones are long dead.

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,194
But getting close to a black hole can be incredibly dangerous.

48
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,620
A painful death by ‘spaghettification' awaits you.

49
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,998
Because your feet are closer to the black hole than your head

50
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:52,173
they feel a stronger pull of gravity, enough to pull you apart.

51
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:58,336
As you descend it gets worse, the pulling gets stronger, your body squeezed thinner and straighter

52
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:04,880
until you've been reduced to a thin stream of hot plasma, gobbled up in one final slurp, never to be seen again.

53
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:10,075
Spaghettification is only a risk with smaller black holes, since they have much smaller radii.

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,340
If you go to the center of a galaxy and find a supermassive black hole,

55
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:17,800
you might be able to experience crossing the event horizon.

56
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:22,968
As you approach the event horizon, a distant observer would think they never saw you enter it,

57
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,321
seeing you stop and fade.

58
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:30,669
The last light you emit trickling up and out, away from the event horizon.

59
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:35,098
Meanwhile, from your perspective the void of the black hole rises up to meet you,

60
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:37,956
as light from fewer directions can reach you.

61
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,898
The blackness envelopes you until your only view of the universe you left

62
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,020
is a tiny spot of light.

63
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:49,711
Here, inside the event horizon, space and time are so horribly broken

64
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,731
that real time travel is possible,

65
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:54,856
so it's probably a good thing that nothing gets out.

66
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,991
If anything could escape it could create all sorts of time travel paradoxes

67
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,506
and issues that break the universe.

68
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:06,446
As scary as the event horizon is, it keeps us safe from that drama.

69
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,771
Whether you have survived this long doesn't really matter,

70
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:14,153
as now there is only the certainty of crushing death in your near future.

71
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:18,518
Inside the event horizon space time itself is so bent and warped,

72
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:22,238
that whatever direction you move here, every "forward" you go,

73
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:25,331
leads only towards the center of the black hole.

74
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:29,271
Trying to go any direction only brings you to the center faster.

75
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:33,030
To survive the longest, you must do: nothing.

76
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,569
In the center of the black hole, we find the singularity.

77
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:40,385
A single point with all the matter that has ever crossed the event horizon,

78
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,266
all crushed to a point infinitely small.

79
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:50,166
There is no memory of the things that made it as stuff disappears down the black hole trapdoor forever.

80
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,063
The singularity makes all things equal.

81
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:56,895
This actually breaks the universe in really cool ways.

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,176
We made a whole video about this problem if you want to learn more.

83
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:04,548
But in a nutshell, everything that comes too close becomes black hole matter,

84
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,236
concentrated at the singularity.

85
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:12,276
This lack of a memory of its past, means that a black hole has only three properties:

86
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:15,625
their mass, spin, and electric charge.

87
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,833
Everything else is lost.

88
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:20,859
They're a lot like fundamental particles in that respect.

89
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:25,546
This actually means that every single black hole in the universe is the same.

90
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,770
Sure, their mass is different and some spin faster than others.

91
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:33,856
But If we were to put all the singularities into a magical physics museum,

92
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:36,770
they would be identical, like electrons.

93
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:43,423
But just like fundamental particles, the properties of singularities are the best ways we can describe them on paper,

94
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:47,060
rather than an accurate representation of reality.

95
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:51,085
Our current theories about the Universe, namely general relativity,

96
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,386
are just not able to describe or explain them.

97
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:59,436
The curvature of space becomes infinite, density becomes infinite,

98
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,418
and our rules just don't make sense.

99
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:05,485
The singularity has no surface or size,

100
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,164
something like a divide-by-zero error in the universe.

101
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:14,543
So singularities might not even exist or be completely different things.

102
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,858
But this is all we know right now, from the best prediction we have,

103
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:20,653
from our best current theory of spacetime.

104
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:25,270
Also, basically everything you've ever heard about black holes, even in this video,

105
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:30,740
is about theoretical black holes that aren't spinning, because their math is so much easier.

106
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:37,158
But since black holes were born from dying stars that were spinning extremely quickly in their last moments, as far as we know,

107
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:40,760
all black holes in the universe should be spinning right now.

108
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:45,333
At incredible speeds too, up to 90 % the speed of light.

109
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:51,506
This means in reality, black holes are even more screwed up than they usually get credit for.

110
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,210
The singularities of rotating black holes are even wilder.

111
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:01,210
The rotation causes them to swell outwards into a sort of ringularity.

112
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:06,106
This rotation is so powerful, that space itself is dragged along.

113
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,860
This creates another region around spinning black holes, called the Ergosphere

114
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,526
where it's impossible to stay still, no matter how hard you try.

115
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:19,105
Like a rushing whirlpool of spacetime, the tide is irresistible

116
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,350
and black hole makes you orbit it whether you want to or not.

117
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,416
Ok. So what will happen with black holes as the universe ages and dies around them?

118
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,799
Again, we don't know but have some ideas based on our current understanding of physics:

119
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,808
Hawking radiation.

120
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:42,353
In quantum field theory the vacuum of space is boiling with quantum fluctuations.

121
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:47,458
These fluctuations are creating matter and
antimatter pairs of particles from nothing

122
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:51,426
which only exist for a very short time before annihilating.

123
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,438
When this happens near the event horizon of a black hole,

124
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:58,673
one of these particles can fall in, stopping them from annihilating.

125
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,158
The escaping particle is Hawking radiation.

126
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:05,771
Ultimately, the mass of this particle must come from the black hole,

127
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:10,110
so over eons black holes will shrink and radiate away.

128
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:13,778
Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole,

129
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,895
it's new stuff, stealing mass from it.

130
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,991
As the black hole shrinks the Hawking radiation gets stronger, faster and faster,

131
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:27,788
until what's left eventually evaporates in a flash of high energy radiation like a nuclear bomb.

132
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:30,136
And then, nothing.

133
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:32,868
But that won't happen for a long long time.

134
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:38,641
A black hole with the mass of our sun has a lifetime of 10^67 years.

135
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:45,385
Which means that it would take 10,000 billion, billion, billion, billion,billion, billion years,

136
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:52,223
to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.

137
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:56,185
But most black holes are way more massive than our sun.

138
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,701
The most massive supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies

139
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:03,481
have lifetimes of 10^100 years.

140
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:05,546
How long is that?

141
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:11,746
Imagine an hourglass, filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe.

142
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:17,086
Every ten billion years one single grain of sand falls to the bottom.

143
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,830
If we waited for the entire sand to fall down,

144
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:24,486
not even a percent of the lifetimes of these black holes would have passed.

145
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:30,280
There is no good concept for our brains to grasp these time scales.

146
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:34,053
Will we ever truly understand black holes?

147
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,478
Really know what's going on inside them?

148
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,185
No one knows.

149
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,888
We can only see their outsides, and the theories we have probably get their insides wrong.

150
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:46,003
But it's okay to not know everything.

151
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,765
It just means there is still work to be done.

152
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:53,550
It means there are still mysteries to solve and big ideas to think about,

153
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:55,765
which is why humans do science.

154
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:01,001
In the end we at least can be sure that we still have plenty of time left to think about them

155
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:05,196
before the last one melts away.

156
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,416
If you want to continue thinking about black holes,

157
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:15,743
you can do so by getting one of the many black hole related things the Kurzgesagt team made with love.

158
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:21,646
Like our Black Hole Infographic Poster that teaches you all the Black Hole basics.

159
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:24,808
Or our Choose Your Own Black Hole Adventure Poster

160
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:29,038
that takes you on a spectacular ride and might leave you in need of a cuddle.

161
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:32,221
In which case we made a Black Hole & White Hole Plushie.

162
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:37,320
And if that's still not enough we also just released super comfy Space Socks,

163
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,733
very shiny Space Pins, a new Tote Bag & Pouch Set

164
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:47,320
and have many other great space related products that are all designed with love and care by us here at kurzgesagt.

165
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,791
Getting something from our shop is the best way to support kurzgesagt while getting something beautiful in return.

166
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:58,081
Because of you we can keep making elaborate videos like the one you just watched,

167
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:00,541
and release them for everyone.

168
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:03,890
Thank you so much for your support!
