1
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:03,730
Friends make life good.

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:07,777
They provide the  scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun.

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,166
They give us a sense of meaning  and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,697
Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel

5
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:23,436
and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,753
But maybe you have scrolled through your phone,  unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with or ask for comfort.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,482
to celebrate with or ask for comfort.

8
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:33,847
You may realize that you don’t have enough friends and feel lonely.

9
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:35,930
And it is not just you.

10
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:39,327
Disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread.

11
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:43,215
Many people want more close friends  but don’t know how to get them.

12
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:46,840
Surprisingly nowadays loneliness is highest among  young people

13
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:50,887
– whose relationships were also hit especially hard by the global pandemic.

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,185
Social  distancing stopped teens and young adults from mingling in classrooms, clubs or dorms.

15
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:01,265
Millions  of friendships, maybe lifelong friendships, that might have blossomed will never exist.

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,079
With profound long term consequences for our collective happiness.

17
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:07,565
The good news is that it is not too  late

18
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,369
and there are lots of friends to be found.

19
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:14,258
We’ll mix scientific information  with actionable advice in this video,

20
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,907
but we can’t address every individual situation.

21
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:19,870
People, cultures and schedules are different.

22
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,722
If you suffer from chronic loneliness

23
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:24,526
you  can also watch the video we made about it.

24
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,409
Ok. As with all important things in life, making friends is infuriatingly simple but not necessarily easy.

25
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:32,304
making friends is infuriatingly simple but not necessarily easy.

26
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:36,589
But it works through a few pretty straight forward mechanisms.

27
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:40,028
The Most Important Thing about Making Friends

28
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:44,711
People make friends with other people  when they spend casual time together.

29
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:47,859
This is how our ancestors formed their  relationships,

30
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:50,584
because humans lived in small, close knit communities in which  options for making friends were limited,

31
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,915
in which  options for making friends were limited,

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,778
so we just formed good relationships  with the people who were around us.

33
00:01:56,804 --> 00:02:01,010
This is why it is so easy to form new friendships in school and university.

34
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:04,714
Society locks you and your peers in a building for several years.

35
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,894
You share similar activities but more importantly:
Similar schedules.

36
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:13,894
Overlapping  and fluctuating social circles
form naturally giving you regular facetime

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,910
and  shared experiences with many different people.

38
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:21,249
Time to find others with similar
worldviews or senses of humor.

39
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,952
Proximity can be more important than similar  interests.

40
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:30,984
One study found that in student dormitories, the distance
between rooms was the  strongest friendship predictor

41
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,998
– living closer together meant a higher chance of becoming friends.

42
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:42,961
Another study showed that being physically present in a class a
lot, without saying a word, makes others more sympathetic to you.

43
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:48,861
So the most important principle of making  friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world.

44
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:53,562
This alone can make it happen automatically and trumps all other advice.

45
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:57,769
But don’t forget that making friends  is not a numbers game or a competition,

46
00:02:57,794 --> 00:02:59,779
don’t compare yourself to others.

47
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:04,095
Everyone  has a social calibrator that can change as  you go through life.

48
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:06,450
Maybe you were  more introverted as a teen

49
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:09,173
but yearn for connection in your twenties.

50
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:14,386
Maybe you  were part of sprawling social circles
but prefer fewer friends in your thirties.

51
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,233
There is no right or wrong, only right for you.

52
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,371
Why we don’t have enough friends

53
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:26,883
The main reason for a lack of friendships is the trite fact that most people do not  prioritize friendships nearly enough.

54
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,804
They don’t realize until it is too late, that retaining
friendships demands regular energy and attention.

55
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:38,219
Although they are so important for  happiness, friends often take a backseat to other life decisions.

56
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:42,584
Work, commuting, romance or kids  take up so much time and energy

57
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,688
that it is so much easier to crash on your
couch and lose yourself in mindless activities.

58
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:54,734
Especially as an adult, going for a bike ride, getting dinner or visiting  a hobby store takes much more mental effort and
commitment

59
00:03:54,833 --> 00:04:00,762
than it did after school, when time ran
slower and energy and curiosity were abundant.

60
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:03,593
But it is not just adults who  are too busy for friends.

61
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:07,064
The average American teenager spends  more time on Tik Tok every day,

62
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:11,973
than socializing at parties, events  or on the phone with friends combined.

63
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:16,576
Established friendships don't require the  same time investment as early friendships to keep up

64
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,168
– but they do require some  commitment.

65
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:25,650
As life distracts you, it’s easy to skip out on checking in when a  friend goes through exciting or depressing times.

66
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:30,439
And so many friendships fade for  lack of attention, often by accident.

67
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:34,804
Which is extra tragic because there is never only one person losing a friend.

68
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,291
 It’s always at least two.

69
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:42,137
Another thing that makes many people vulnerable  is the way friendship networks are structured.

70
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:47,693
The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that  on average, most people have fewer friends than their friends.

71
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:54,072
Which makes sense, since you  are more likely to be friends with someone who has many friends, than with someone who has few.

72
00:04:54,097 --> 00:05:00,159
Rather than being densely interconnected, friend
networks are often built around central hubs.

73
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:05,529
So if central people disappear from your life, this can deprive you of many connections at once.

74
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,519
And it can lead to a distorted self perception:

75
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:12,649
that you are less popular than others, although you are perfectly average.

76
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,585
It can get worse quickly with big life  events.

77
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,400
Maybe you moved for school, work or love and are left without  social networks.

78
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:25,847
Or you had a break up that left you with the smaller  part of the formerly shared social pie.

79
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:24,268


80
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,615
The reasons why you find yourself with less connection than you want are as diverse as people,

81
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,287
but the underlying cause is almost always:

82
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,312
Time.

83
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:35,901
There is no shortcut.

84
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,032
To make new friends and retain friendships

85
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:43,667
you have to prioritize relationships, spend time with people  in real life and make them feel that you care.

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,143
So take a look at yourself and  rebalance what you spend your life doing.

87
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,524
How to make new Friends

88
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:57,327
Studies have shown that new friendships can  develop quite quickly, weeks after you meet someone.

89
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,744
But it takes a few months for a casual  friendship to become a close relationship

90
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:06,981
– with the biggest impediment being time invested  and the quality of your interactions.

91
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:13,744
To make friends it helps if you  intentionally look for people
you have things in common with and  who are open to new relationships.

92
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,189
You want to make it easy for yourself, so examine  what kind of person you are.

93
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,089
Generally speaking, extroverts tend to crave sensory stimulation,

94
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:26,190
spicier foods, loud music, or the excitement of engaging a crowd.

95
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,703
Introverts, often confused with  shy people,

96
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:31,243
tend to be more sensitive to sensory stimulants

97
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:36,111
and prefer quieter surroundings,  fewer people and even less spicy food.

98
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,269
Different places attract different people.

99
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:41,470
Not everybody can easily make friends at a bar or a football game,

100
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:45,358
not everybody finds a stroll through a park or book
store stimulating.

101
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:48,379
Men especially form  friendships around shared activities

102
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:51,898
but in general it is a good idea to  go to places that feel comfortable,

103
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:55,496
where there are people you might like,  who do things you find interesting.

104
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,881
Look for local clubs or opportunities to volunteer.

105
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:02,796
Check out what hobby stores are around and dust off your Space Marines,

106
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:07,109
or  see if there are new DnD groups in your city and ask if you could join one.

107
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:10,059
Check meet  up apps for gaming nights or wine tasting,

108
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:14,530
join a sports club or look for people  who go hiking or want to cook together.

109
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:17,969
Another obvious avenue is your professional life.

110
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:23,966
It helps if you work in a job that attracts  people you like, so you might consider this when you choose a career.

111
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,405
Deepening your  relationship with colleagues can lead to great friendships,

112
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,109
especially if you look for peers and there is no power imbalance.

113
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:34,299
And of course there are friends you’ve lost touch with.

114
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:37,099
You may be able to revive some of these relationships.

115
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:41,146
In some cases all it needs is a call or an invitation.

116
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:46,093
Research shows that more often than not, the other person  will appreciate that you’ve reached out!

117
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:50,345
There are likely way more opportunities to spend time with others than you are aware of.

118
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,790
And if there aren’t, you can take the initiative and  create them.

119
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:57,574
Invitations are signals to start friendships.

120
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:04,281
So bring people together by having a dinner party, organizing a football game after work or starting a board game group.

121
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,138
Everybody  appreciates people who organize fun things

122
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:13,792
and the simple act of reaching out can kickstart a  self propelling upward spiral of well being,fun and connectedness

123
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:18,316
that can seriously improve the  life of everyone around you in meaningful ways.

124
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:22,670
If you meet someone you vibe with it is pretty  scary to make the first move

125
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,099
but they may feel
the same way.

126
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:28,819
Equally interested in a friendship  but also blocked by fear of rejection.

127
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:30,870
So it is worth going for it.

128
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,342
Worst case, they are not interested which will sting for a few hours

129
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,976
– but the best case could be a lifelong friendship.

130
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:39,801
A risk well worth the reward.

131
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,805
Once you have formed early connections

132
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,860
check in when they have important things happening in their life.

133
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,276
Of course it is important not to be overbearing

134
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:53,050
but the more time you invest, the more opportunity you have to engage in meaningful banter or silly jokes.

135
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:57,847
The fact that friendships take time also means that you need to be patient  and kind with yourself,

136
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,287
especially if you are out of practice.

137
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:05,830
Things will not improve overnight but slowly, step by step, if you keep it up.

138
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,534
Open Up: Care and Share

139
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:11,201
Many people don’t have an issue being around others

140
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:15,019
but struggle to turn acquaintances into friends.

141
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,523
So let us talk about two important principles  that make it more likely that you’ll connect:

142
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,606
Caring and sharing.

143
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:25,595
In general, our favorite  topic is ourselves and the things we care about,

144
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,829
because we are literally at the center of our own universe.

145
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,618
So People tend to like people who are genuinely interested  in them.

146
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:37,373
So if you want to make friends, your goal should be trying to  learn what makes them tick.

147
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:42,065
Just as important as caring about others  is reciprocity and openness.

148
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:46,827
To connect you need to share the experiences that made you, you.

149
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:51,177
Now you don’t want to overwhelm the other person and immediately spill out  your deepest secrets.

150
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:54,074
But open up a little and reveal personal things

151
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:57,646
– because this  also signals to others that it is ok to do the same.

152
00:09:57,671 --> 00:10:01,063
The best case is that you find shared experiences

153
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:03,305
– maybe you both had a hard time in school,

154
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:06,242
maybe you share a passion for weird movies.

155
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:13,429
Learning about others and sharing personal  stories in a
balanced way and not overdoing it, is not an exact science.

156
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:20,317
Noticing the  line between opening up and oversharing requires
practice and depends  on the vibe of the conversation.

157
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:27,474
One of the perplexities of life is that to get something, it can be helpful to convince yourself  that you want it less than you do.

158
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:32,137
In general it is good to be laid back, have fun and enjoy yourself.

159
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,766
Do things for yourself without expectations,

160
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,190
but also be open to social opportunities

161
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:40,277
and accept invitations if they show up.

162
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:42,479
And that's basically it.

163
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,337
Give friendships more priority in your life.

164
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:49,146
Check in with friends and regularly go to things to have fun.

165
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:54,836
Show genuine interest  in others and give them the opportunity to know you without selling yourself too  hard.

166
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,328
If you do this you are on track.

167
00:10:57,353 --> 00:11:03,368
If this sounds a bit scary, the good news is that human brains are hardwired to seek connection.

168
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:09,456
It is perfectly normal to seek out new friends and there
are many people who would welcome more close relationships.

169
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,840
There are friendships up for grabs everywhere

170
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:16,860
and there are plenty of people who will be so happy  to have YOU in their life.

171
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:19,996
As a good friend. Go get to know them!

172
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:27,258
For a short time, there is a free, community  organized, world wide Kurzgesagt meetup!

173
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,321
If you are over 18 and want to take part:

174
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:32,325
go to  our temporary subreddit that our community set up for you

175
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,769
and look for your area or city, to find a Kurzgesagt meet up near you.

176
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:42,064
If there isn’t one, don’t be shy- set  it up yourself to meet like minded people.

177
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,211
In order to make this less intimidating,
we’ve created a small toolbox for you,

178
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:52,144
with some guidance and ideas on what you could  do and
where you could meet up, as well as conversation starters.

179
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:55,926
Check out the website  or subreddit for further information and tips!

180
00:11:55,978 --> 00:12:02,605
Please note that this is an experiment, it is free
and self organized by Kurzgesagt viewers like you.

181
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,747
The subreddit will be open for  3 weeks and will be made private after.

182
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,244
We want to create more things to  make finding friends easier for you,

183
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,331
you can also sign up so we can let you know as soon as something is ready!

184
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:20,926
We want to be part of your friendship journey, so we’ve
created a few things you can share with new and old friends!

185
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:25,554
Two wormhole pins to connect you and your BFF  no matter where you are.

186
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,395
If you want to share something with your entire friend group – get a  little bird pin for each of them.

187
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,813
They are all unique but fit together like pieces of a puzzle.

188
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:37,849
Or get matching posters to let your friends know  you’re thinking of them.

189
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:41,658
Or just browse all the sciency things we made for you!

190
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:46,995
If you like videos like this, getting something from our shop is the  best way to support us!

191
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,861
Thank you for watching.
