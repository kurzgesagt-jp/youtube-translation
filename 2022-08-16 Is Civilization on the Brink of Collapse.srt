1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,146
At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 30% of the world’s population,

2
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:11,440
and in many ways it was the pinnacle of human advancement.

3
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:16,061
Its citizens enjoyed the benefits of central heating, concrete, double glazing,

4
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:20,507
banking, international trade, and upward social mobility.

5
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,424
Rome became the first city in history with one million inhabitants

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,837
and was a center of technological, legal, and economic progress.

7
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:34,290
An empire impossible to topple, stable and rich and powerful.

8
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,885
Until it wasn’t anymore.

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,547
First slowly then suddenly, the most powerful civilization on earth collapsed.

10
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:47,080
By civilization, we mean a complex society where labor is specialized

11
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:51,280
and social classes emerge and which is ruled by institutions.

12
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:54,888
Civilisations share a dominant mutual language and culture

13
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:59,377
and domesticate plants and animals to feed and sustain large cities,

14
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:03,110
where they often construct impressive monuments.

15
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:06,776
Civilization lets us become efficient on large scales,

16
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:13,076
collect vast amounts of knowledge, and put human ingenuity and the natural resources of the world to work.

17
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:17,006
Without civilization, most people would never have been born.

18
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:22,600
Which makes it a bit concerning that collapse is the rule, not the exception.

19
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:28,374
Virtually all civilizations end, on average after 340 years.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,386
Collapse is rarely nice for individuals.

21
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:37,321
Their shared cultural identity is shattered as institutions lose the power to organize people.

22
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:43,810
Knowledge is lost, living standards fall, violence increases and often the population declines.

23
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:46,537
The civilization either completely disappears,

24
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:50,374
is absorbed by stronger neighbors or something new emerges,

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,123
sometimes with more primitive technology than before.

26
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,466
If this is how it has been over the ages, what about us today?

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,013
Just as Europeans forgot how to build indoor plumbing and make cement,

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,897
will we lose our industrial technology, and with that our greatest achievements,

29
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:19,273
from one dollar pizza to smartphones or laser eye surgery?

30
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,618
Will all this go away too?

31
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:25,356
Today our cities stretch for thousands of square kilometers,

32
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:29,448
we travel the skies, our communication is instant.

33
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,887
Industrial agriculture with engineered high yield plants,

34
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:38,233
efficient machinery and high potency fertilizer feeds billions of people.

35
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,635
Modern medicine gives us the longest lifespan we’ve ever had,

36
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,424
while Industrial technology gives us an unprecedented level of comfort and abundance

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,670
 – even though we haven’t yet learned to attain them without destroying our ecosphere.

38
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:58,790
There are arguably still different civilizations around today that compete and coexist with each other,

39
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:03,794
but together they also form a singular, global civilization.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,900
But this modern, globalized civilization is even more vulnerable in some ways than past empires,

41
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:13,760
because we are much more deeply interconnected.

42
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:20,117
A collapse of the industrialized world literally means that the majority of people alive today would perish

43
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:25,014
since without industrial agriculture we would no longer be able to feed them.

44
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:27,649
And there is an even greater risk:

45
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:33,460
What if a collapse were so deeply destructive that we were unable to re-industrialize again?

46
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:40,224
What if it ruined our chances of enjoying a flourishing future as a multiplanetary species?

47
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,454
A global civilizational collapse could be an existential catastrophe:

48
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,067
something that ruins not just the lives of everyone alive today,

49
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:51,516
but all the future generations that could have come into being.

50
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:55,441
All the knowledge we might have discovered, the art we might have created,

51
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:59,174
the joys we might have experienced, would be lost.

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,503
So, how likely is all of this?

53
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,698
Let’s start with some good news.

54
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:07,680
While civilization collapses have happened regularly,

55
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,726
none have ever derailed the course of global civilization.

56
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,631
Rome collapsed, but the Aksumite Empire or the Teotihuacans

57
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:19,373
and of course the Byzantine Empire, carried on.

58
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,300
What about sudden population crashes?

59
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:27,617
So far we have not seen a catastrophe that has killed much more than 10% of the global population.

60
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,290
No pandemic, no natural disaster, no war.

61
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:35,770
The last clear example of a rapid global population decrease was the Black Death,

62
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:40,857
a pandemic of the bubonic plague in the fourteenth century that spread across the Middle East and Europe

63
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:46,260
and killed a third of all Europeans and about 1/10th of the global population.

64
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,514
If any event was going to cause the collapse of civilization, that should have been it.

65
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,327
But even the Black Death demonstrates humanity's resilience more than its fragility.

66
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:03,537
While the old societies were massively disrupted in the short term, the intense loss of human lives and suffering

67
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:09,560
did little to negatively impact European economic and technological development in the long run.

68
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:12,354
Population size recovered within 2 centuries,

69
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,513
and just 2 centuries later, the Industrial Revolution began.

70
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:21,753
History is full of incredible recoveries from horrible tragedies.

71
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,485
Take the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War 2.

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:32,914
140,000 people were killed and 90% of the city was at least partially incinerated or reduced to rubble.

73
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,543
But against all odds, they made a remarkable recovery!

74
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:43,567
Hiroshima’s population recovered within a decade, and today it is a thriving city of 1.2 million people.

75
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,934
None of this made these horrible events any less horrible for those who lived through them.

76
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,494
But for us as a species, these signs of resilience are good news.

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,660
Why Recovery is Likely Even in the Worst Case

78
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:04,727
One thing that’s different from historic collapses is that humanity now has unprecedented destructive power:

79
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:12,417
Today’s nuclear arsenals are so powerful that an all-out global war could cause a nuclear winter and billions of deaths.

80
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:17,564
Our knowledge of our own biology and how to manipulate it is getting so advanced

81
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:24,327
that it is becoming possible to engineer viruses as contagious as the coronavirus and as deadly as ebola.

82
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:29,800
Increasingly the risk of global pandemics is much higher than in the past.

83
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:35,986
So we may cause a collapse ourselves and it might be much worse than the things nature has thrown at us, so far.

84
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:41,671
But if, say 99% of the population died, would global civilization collapse forever?

85
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:44,640
Could we recover from such a tragedy?

86
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,954
We have some reasons to be optimistic. Let’s start with food.

87
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,030
There are 1 billion agricultural workers today so, even if the global population fell to just 80 million,

88
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:59,417
it is virtually guaranteed that many survivors would know how to produce food.

89
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:04,454
And we don’t need to start at square one because we could still use modern high-yield crops.

90
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,331
Maize is 10 times bigger than its wild ancestor;

91
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:12,073
ancient tomatoes were the size of today’s peas.

92
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,937
After agriculture, the next step towards recovery would be rebuilding industrial capacity,

93
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:21,257
like power grids and automated manufacturing.

94
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:27,497
A huge problem is that our economies of scale make it impossible to just pick up where we left off.

95
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:31,760
Many of our high tech industries are only functional because of huge demand

96
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:36,494
and intensely interconnected supply chains across different continents.

97
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,550
Even if our infrastructure were left unharmed, we would make huge steps backwards technologically.

98
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:46,240
But then again, we are thinking in larger time frames.

99
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:51,587
Industrialization originally happened 12,000 years after the agricultural revolution.

100
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:54,657
So if we need to start over after a massive collapse,

101
00:07:54,683 --> 00:08:00,297
it shouldn’t be that hard to re-industrialize, at least on evolutionary timescales.

102
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:04,429
There’s a hitch, though. The Industrial Revolution was fuelled, literally,

103
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:09,663
by burning easily-accessible coal and we are still very much reliant on it.

104
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:17,327
If we use it all up today, aside from making rapid climate change much worse, we could hinder our ability to recover from a huge crisis.

105
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:20,150
So we should stop using easy-to-access coal,

106
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:25,583
so it can serve as a civilization insurance in case something bad happens.

107
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:32,250
Another thing that makes recovery likely is that we’d probably have most of the information we need to rebuild civilization.

108
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:38,906
We would certainly lose a lot of crucial institutional knowledge, especially on hard drives that nobody could read or operate anymore.

109
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:46,434
But a lot of the technological, scientific, and cultural knowledge stored in the world's 2.6 million libraries, would survive the catastrophe.

110
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:54,437
The post-collapse survivors would know what used to be possible, and they could reverse engineer some of the tools and machines they’d find.

111
00:08:54,463 --> 00:08:58,327
In conclusion, despite the bleak prospect of catastrophic threats,

112
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:02,480
natural or created by ourselves, there is reason for optimism:

113
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:08,440
humankind is remarkably resilient, and even in the case of a global civilizational collapse,

114
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,383
it seems likely that we would be able to recover

115
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:15,693
– Even if many people were to perish or suffer immense hardship.

116
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:20,580
Even if we lost cultural and technological achievements in the process.

117
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:25,013
But given the stakes, the risks are still unnervingly high.

118
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:31,279
Nuclear war and dangerous pandemics threaten the amazing global civilization we have built.

119
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:37,329
Humanity is like a teenager, speeding around blind corners, drunk, without a seat belt.

120
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:42,831
The good news is that it is still early enough to prepare for and to mitigate these risks.

121
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,713
We just need to actually do it.

122
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,317
We made this video together with Will MacAskill,

123
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:53,797
a Professor of Philosophy at Oxford and one of the founders of the effective altruism movement,

124
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:57,360
which is about doing the most good you can with your time and money.

125
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:01,114
Will just published a new book called What We Owe The Future,

126
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,374
which is about how YOU can positively impact the long-term future of our world.

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,200
If you like Kurzgesagt videos, the chances are high you will like it!

128
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,924
The book has some pretty counter intuitive arguments,

129
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,083
like that risks from new technology, such as AI and synthetic biology,

130
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,935
are at least as grave as those from climate change.

131
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,000
Or that the world doesn’t contain too many people, but too few.

132
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:28,440
And especially that everyday actions like recycling or refusing to fly

133
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:33,350
just aren’t that big a deal compared to where you donate, or what career you pursue.

134
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:36,740
Most importantly, it argues that, by acting wisely,

135
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,706
YOU can help make tomorrow better than today.

136
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:46,490
And how WE together can build a flourishing world for the thousands or millions of generations that will come after us.

137
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:52,080
Many things we at Kurzgesagt talk about regularly are discussed here, in much greater detail.

138
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:57,536
Check out What We Owe The Future wherever you get your books or audiobooks.

139
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,900
Did we manage to unlock a new fear for you?

140
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:07,573
Let’s counter existential dread with appreciation for humanity.

141
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:12,890
Look how far we’ve come as a species. What we’ve built and where we’ve gathered.

142
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:18,886
Let this new World Map Poster be a reminder of what we can achieve.
