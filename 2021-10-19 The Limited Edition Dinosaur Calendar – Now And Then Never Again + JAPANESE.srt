00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As the year 12.021 slowly comes to an end,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we present to you the 12.022 human era calendar, Eons edition.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As always,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we're adding 10.000 years to the regular calendar to represent the human era

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and include all cultures around the world,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but this year we're expanding the scope beyond humanity

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to showcase forgotten animals and plants from all across the phanerozoic Eon

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
like giant armored fish scythe lizards or giant sloths, on 12 elaborate pages.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Witness how multicellular life has persisted for over half a billion years,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans and of course pandemics.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In the end, life er... finds a way,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we want to celebrate that.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can get the very shiny high quality limited edition now, until we set out and

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
then never again, to support what we do on this channel, to fill the void

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in your soul, or just to have something beautiful to look at.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As every year, we also have bundles and special calendar deals

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
with some of your favourite products.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you so much to all of the thousands of birds who get the calendar every year,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you enable us to create videos and to publish them for free for everyone.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We wish you a happy year 12.022.
